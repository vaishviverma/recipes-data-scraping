Note: Before running any script, you must properly download the chromedriver folder, depending on your OS. After this, replace the path in each script with the path of your chromedriver. To find where to replace, simply search "chromedriver".

There is 'dassanalinks.txt' file which contains recipe links only.
Note: The script to create this file has been lost, but is simple to write. We will update with the proper script soon enough.

Step 1: Chromedriver setup based on the above note.

Step 2: Run dassana.py. This scrapes data from each recipe's link and stores it in a csv - 'dassana_veg_recipes.csv'.
