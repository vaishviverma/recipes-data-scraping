“Sizzling Beef” Steak Fried Rice,"Recipe video above. This is a bit special because it's rare to see fried rice made with juicy bites of steak!

The chewy muesli bars also have a higher ratio of honey and peanut butter which is what makes them chewy! PS Even though they're sugar free, I munch on these when I need a sweet-treat fix, yet they're healthy enough for breakfast.","Australian, Western",4.94 from 15 votes,"['1/4 cup honey (Note 1)', '1/4 cup natural peanut butter, smooth (or crunchy!)

Crispy Salt & Pepper Squid,"Recipe video above. It only took us 3 years to crack the ultimate, truly crispy Salt and Pepper Squid! Hand on heart, this is crispier than any squid I've had in a restaurant, ever. The fry batter is light, super crunchy and not greasy at all. In fact, it's so crispy it stays crispy even when it's stone cold! After eliminating rice flour, potato flour and tapioca, we found the perfect ratio of flour to cornflour (cornstarch) that fries up crunchy in mere minutes, before the squid can overcook. But the final key was refrigerating the batter for 30 minutes.

Beef Tenderloin with Creamy Mushroom Sauce,"Recipe video above.

Hasselback potatoes,"Recipe video above. Soft on the inside and crispy on the edges, brushed with garlic rosemary olive oil! Hasselback success relies on thin slices so they fan out as they bake, allowing oil and salt to drip in between with crispy edges. Otherwise, they end up like regular roast spuds!

Fluffy Ricotta Pancakes,"Recipe video above. Ricotta pancakes are a step up from plain ones because they are extra soft and fluffy inside.

Whipped cream – with stabilised option,"Recipe video above. My recipe for whipped cream that I use for ""everything"". It's actually Chantilly cream, the French name for whipped cream that's lightly sweetened and flavoured with vanilla. Use to decorate cakes, pipe onto cupcakes, dollop on fruit and swirl onto sundaes! ⚠️ IMPORTANT: You MUST use whipping cream, not pouring cream that cannot be whipped! Check the carton label – they should say if the cream is for whipping. Some readers have had issues with the cream not whipping and I suspect that is the reason. 😢 Stabilised whipped cream – To make whipped cream hold its fluffy texture and piped form for 2 to 3 days (it won't deflate or melt), stabilise it by adding mascarpone. It won't alter the flavour or texture. Other methods (like cornflour/cornstarch, gelatine) are unreliable or not as pleasant to eat. Yield – Cream doubles in volume when whipped.

So I like that it's not a dominant flavour here, hazelnut is. Olive oil gives this cake a rich brownie-like texture in a way that butter never will. I'm addicted to the meringue-like crispy edges – I want to slice it all off and run away with it!

Saltimbocca,"Recipe video above. This rustic Italian classic is fabulously quick to make thanks to thin slices of veal that cook in 2 1/2 minutes flat.

Pad See Ew – Thai Stir Fried Noodles,"Recipe video above. Pad See Ew (which means Stir Fried Soy Sauce noodles) is one of the most popular Thai street foods. Traditionally made with Sen Yai which are wide, thin rice noodles which are not that easy to come by. So use dried rice noodles instead – I've eaten enough Pad See Ew at Thai restaurants to assure you that there is no compromise on flavour! KEY TIP FOR SUCCESS: Cook the chicken separately from the noodles. Home stoves are no match for the fierce heat of restaurant and street vendor burners.

Ultimate slow-roasted lamb: 12-hour Lamb Shoulder,"Recipe video above. A 3-hour lamb shoulder is great. A 12-hour lamb shoulder is better! The meat is even more succulent because a lower cooking temperature means less moisture loss, and better flavour infusion from the rub. The sauce is a Lamb Jus made using the braising juices so it has phenomenal flavour. Don't be intimidated, it's simple and no more difficult to make than gravy! This is an excellent make-ahead recipe for gatherings. Why? Because you can make up to 4 shoulders in one standard oven.

This recipe uses a proven method used in my Honey Chicken recipe for Honey Prawns that stays crispy hours even after coating in the sauce! 1. Double coating – cornflour/cornstarch to seal in juices, followed by batter. 2. Cold batter made with soda water = crispier coating that's puffy and light, not dense and greasy. 3. Cornflour/cornstarch + flour batter – cornflour for ultra crispiness, flour for golden colour. 4. Double fry for extra long lasting, thicker crispiness AND less greasy (Asian secret!). 5. No-soggy Sauce – glucose or corn syrup to make it ""candy like"" to stick on the prawn crust rather than soaking in, plus NO WATER in the sauce. Note – the sauce is sweet.

Thai Yellow Curry (from scratch!),"Recipe video above. Thai curries are famous for the sublime aromatic flavours balancing sweet, tart, savoury and spiciness. Thai Yellow Curry is one such magnificent example, with its rich yellow colour, incredible depth of flavour and a heady combination of both fresh and ground herbs and spices. This is made from scratch with a homemade Yellow Curry Paste. There are quite a few ingredients involved but if you truly want the best, it's worth it! This is a creation the RecipeTin Team is proud to call our own – we worked damn hard on it!

Malfatti (Italian Spinach Ricotta Dumplings in Napoli Sauce),"Recipe video above. Malfatti means “badly formed” in Italian. These irregular spinach ricotta gnocchi-like dumplings may look a bit wonky, but they taste incredible!

Chocolate Mirror Glaze,"Recipe video above. Deceptively straight forward, it mainly takes patience! The 3 key things for a flawless, reflective mirror glaze are: 1. Smooth frosting and level cake – because bumps and dents show up on shiny glazes. See my tutorial for How to Make Frosting Smooth on Cakes; 2. Ensure the glaze is completely smooth (just follow my recipe); and 3. Ensure the glaze is at 30°C/86° so it spreads smoothly for a thin, flawless finish. Proper Mirror Glazes are no thicker than 3mm and are not made with condensed milk, for superior results (read in post for more info).

Crispy Potato Rosti,"Recipe video above. This is a recipe for truly crispy Potato Rosti that's beautifully golden on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The secret is pan frying in the right fat!

Classic Whirlpool Method - requires more practice but best if striving for the ""perfect"" poached egg shape, or sense of accomplishment!

Do not skip straining to remove watery whites which is what causes a mess with poached eggs. (Unless you've got just-laid eggs!) Fresh eggs make the best shaped, tidy poached eggs.

How to cook rice – perfectly and easily,"Recipe video above. Use this recipe for short, medium and long grain white rice. See separate recipes for: jasmine, basmati and brown rice. Stovetop yields the best result for perfect, evenly cooked fluffy rice. This is my default, favourite method.

DO NOT RINSE your rice, you do not need to rinse for fluffy rice (read in post for more information). Exception: if you are concerned about cleanness (eg purchased from sacks at markets).

Homemade Sausage Rolls,"Recipe video above. ""The secret is the bacon..."" It really takes this sausage roll to another level! Also, sautéing the onion and celery before mixing into the filling makes it sweet and more moist than the usual, and using panko instead of normal breadcrumbs also contributes to making the filling of this sausage roll so moist. The addition of fennel adds an extra burst of flavour but it's optional.

Lasagna,"Recipe video above. One of my signature recipes! This is a lasagna made the traditional Italian way, with a slow cooked ragu and a béchamel sauce (""Besciamella"").

Makes 8 giant or 10 normal servings. This lasagna has 4 layers of lasagna sheets with 3 layers of meat and cheese sauce, then finished with a cheese sauce topping.

Jamie Oliver's Chicken in Milk {Seriously Delish},"Though the ingredients list might seem odd, this is actually one of the best chicken dishes I have ever had. Possibly the best roast chicken I've ever had. It's incredibly easy to make and produces a very tender chicken with crispy skin on top. The braising liquid reduces to a fabulous sauce that has a hint of freshness from the lemon and muskiness from the sage and cinnamon. The whole cloves of garlic cook in the skin so they are soft and mushy (mild garlic flavour, much more sweet), perfect for popping out of the skin and eating with the chicken, or spread it on toast!

Bacon Tart with Pumpkin and Maple,"Maple, bacon and pumpkin is a stellar flavour combination. This tart is from the menu of a popular bistro called Pinbone in Woollahra, Sydney. The original recipe required homemade puff pastry. I chose the easier path and made this with frozen puff pastry. In addition the original recipe calls for the pumpkin to be roasted and the caramelisation adds extra flavour. However, sometimes I just steam the pumpkin in the microwave because I find that the difference is barely noticeable due to the strong flavours coming from the bacon and maple syrup. Plus it is much more convenient because the pumpkin is prepared while the oven is preheating, so it is much faster (you save around 30 minutes of cooking time).
