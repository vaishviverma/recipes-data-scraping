Three steps to get recipes:

Step 1: Extract direct links to recipes and store it in a file named "links.txt".
We lost the script for scraping these links, but can be written easily.

Step 2: Download the chromedriver folder, based on your OS, and make sure this folder is not renamed.

Step 3: Run script.py.
