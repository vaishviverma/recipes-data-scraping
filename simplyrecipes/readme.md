Note: Before running any script, you must properly download the chromedriver folder, depending on your OS. After this, replace the path in each script with the path of your chromedriver. To find where to replace, simply search "chromedriver".

We create two .txt files with links:

simplyrecipeslinks_cuisine.txt : Contains recipe links that has Cuisine data
simplyrecipeslinks_no_cuisine.txt : Contains just recipe links without Cuisine data

The script to create these two files have been lost, but are simple to write. The format for these files can be checked from the existing files that have older links.

Once we have these files, run "simplyrecipes.py".
