Picanha Steak With Rice And Beans,"One of Brazil’s most loved grilled meats, the picanha is both the name of the dish and the name of the cut used to make the dish. The cut comes from the top back side of the animal and is located above the butt. The meat is cut into slices which are generously sprinkled, then skewered and cooked over embers. When done, the meat is carved, and the outside slices are served. The remaining picanha meat is salted again, then placed over the embers so the outsides can caramelize and be sliced again for another portion. It is a mainstay at Brazilian churrasqueiras (barbecue restaurants) where it’s served sided with dishes like farofa, rice and beans, and vinaigrette.","Brazil, South America",4.2,"['1 cup (185g) long-grain rice', '1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil', '6 cloves garlic, crushed', '1 tsp chopped chives or parsley', '3 slices bacon, chopped', '1 white onion, chopped', '1/4 cup (60 ml) marsala wine', '1 tsp garlic powder', '1 tbsp tomato paste', 'Kosher salt', 'black pepper, freshly ground', 'pinch crushed red pepper flakes', '2 (15-oz/400g) cans pinto beans', '2 bay leaves', '1 picanha steak, about 2.5 lbs/1.35kg', 'Kosher salt']",4,30min,1h 40min,-,2h 10min,TasteAtlas,"['Add the rice and enough water to cover to a medium pot.

Pastel De Nata,"Flaky, laminated pastry shells filled with a creamy egg yolk custard, flavored with cinnamon, or pastel de nata for short, is the world-famous Portuguese dessert invented by Catholic nuns and monks sometime before the 18th century. The preparation is a lengthy one, and every step should be done with the utmost care. First, the pastry is made by laminating the dough with butter — however, lard was used before, and margarine is commonly used today instead. The custard is made with just milk, water, sugar, and egg yolks, and flavored with cinnamon, or in some recipes also with vanilla and lemon, which has the purpose of cutting the sweetness of the custard. However, in any case, the custard should not be overly sweet. Once the pastry shells have been filled with custard, they are baked in a high-temperature oven for a short time, which gives for a blistering burn on the top that makes these custard tarts instantly recognizable. Pastel de nata should be eaten shortly after baking,...

Guotie With Meat And Cabbage Filling,"Belonging to a group of Chinese jiaozi dumplings, guotie, also known as potstickers, are prepared by searing the bottom part while the rest of the dumpling is steamed, thus creating a play on textures. The preparation begins with making the dough for the wrappers from just flour, salt, and warm water. The dough is then left to rest, and in the meantime, the filling is prepared by mixing minced pork, best if minced by hand using a cleaver, and minced cabbage with, including but not limited to, sesame oil, shrimp, ginger, scallions, peanut oil, soy sauce, and rice wine. Next, the dough is divided into small portions which are rolled into 1-2mm circles using a Chinese rolling pin, which unlike the western one is smaller and shorter. To form the dumplings, a small amount of the filling is spread in the center of each wrapper, and then the opposite sides of the dough are pinched together to seal — the ends are left open, which allows the meat juices to flow out into the pan, making the crust on the bottom more flavorful. The assembled guotie dumplings are arranged in a large, heated, and oiled pan and seared until the bottom browns, at which point, a mixture of flour and water is poured into the pan which is then covered with a lid, and the dumplings are cooked until the liquid boils off.

Authentic Carnitas,"Originating from the state of Michoacán in Mexico, carnitas, which translates to ""little meats"" in Spanish, is made by cooking pork in copious amounts of lard for hours until achieving a perfect balance between tender, juicy meat and crispy, golden brown outside. All parts of the pig are used, including the feet, the head, and the entrails. The meat is usually first roasted until crispy and browned on the outside, then simmered low and slow so it turns fork-tender. Traditionally, the meat is seasoned only with salt, although frequently, recipes will include additional seasonings such as bay leaves, onions, garlic, and orange juice, for example, which all cook in the lard together with meat. Carnitas is traditionally prepared in a large copper pot, which conducts even heating. In a taqueria, you can order carnitas by picking the part of the pig you'd like in your taco or even order a surtida taco with every bit of pig.

Classic Manti,"A member of a world-popular family of dumplings, Turkish manti is a delicious pasta dish traditionally filled with onion, ground meat (most commonly lamb or beef) and spices, covered with aromatic yogurt-garlic sauce and drizzled with tangy red pepper-tomato sauce. The city of Kayseri in Central Anatolia is known for making the best manti, while in Eastern Anatolia a vegetarian version prevails, filled with crushed chickpeas, cumin, and red pepper flakes. First, a dough is prepared by mixing flour, water, salt, and sometimes eggs, and is then rolled out thinly and cut into small squares. Each square is filled with a mixture of ground meat, onion, and spices, and shaped in the form of a small pouch, pinched at the top. The manti dumplings are then baked shortly, after which they are simmered in salted water and drizzled with a white and a red sauce which give freshness and spiciness. Since making manti is time-consuming, most Turkish women get together and turn it into a group project, which makes preparation both quicker and more pleasurable. The main characteristic of Turkish manti is that they are significantly smaller than their ravioli-like relatives in Asian and European cuisines.

Usually, the filling is made with ground pork, Chinese sauerkraut, onions, scallions, garlic chives, prawns, cabbage, and mushrooms, but an entire array of other ingredients may be included.

Cochinita Pibil,"Originating from the Yucatán peninsula, cochinita pibil is a dish with Mayan roots, going back hundreds of years. Traditionally, it is made with a whole suckling pig that is marinated in a paste made predominantly with annatto seeds, then wrapped in banana leaves and baked underground on hot stones until the meat is meltingly tender. However, more practical cuts are preferred for at-home preparation, such as leg and shoulder. These cuts have lots of marbling and connective tissue and cooking them long and slow results in a meltingly tender and juicy meat. The marinade is made by grinding annatto seeds, pepper, Mexican oregano, garlic, onion, cloves, and cinnamon into a powder-like substance that is mixed with sour orange juice and salt. The marinade can also include tomatoes, chiles, cumin, and other spices depending on the recipe. For extra moisture, the marinated meat is often topped with sliced vegetables such as onions, tomatoes, and peppers before it’s covered with ...

Authentic Pempek,"Pempek, also known as empek-empek, is a cherished Indonesian fish cake from Palembang, South Sumatra. It is made with a blend of fish, typically mackerel, sago flour, and simple seasonings. The preparation of pempek starts with grinding the fish into a fine paste, which is then mixed with sago flour and occasionally egg, depending on the recipe, along with seasonings like salt and sugar to enhance its taste. Sometimes, oil is added to make the dough less chewy. This mixture is kneaded into a dough and shaped into various forms, each representing a different variation of pempek. Once shaped, the pempek is boiled until it floats, signifying it is cooked through, and then usually further deep-fried to achieve a crispy exterior. Pempek is typically served cut into bite-sized pieces and topped with cuko, a tangy and sweet sauce made from palm sugar, chili pepper, garlic, vinegar, and salt.

Classic Païdakia,"Païdakia refers to grilled lamb chops known for their rich flavor and tender texture. Traditionally, the rib section of lamb is used. The preparation begins with a robust marinade, typically a blend of olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, mustard, and a medley of herbs like oregano, thyme, and rosemary. This marinade infuses the meat with aromatic flavors and tenderizes it. The lamb chops are then grilled to perfection, often over an open flame, which imparts a distinctive smoky flavor. They're cooked until they reach a desirable level of doneness, usually medium-rare to medium, ensuring they remain juicy and flavorful.

Classic Puff Pastry Croissants,"One of the true classics of French cuisine, croissants are not at all easy to make, but the result — if done right — is truly worth the trouble. This crescent-shaped pastry is usually made with puff pastry dough, but alternatively, it can also be made with leavened dough. A classic croissant is on the verge of sweet and savory, and it can either be plain or filled with chocolate, jam, cheese, ham, or raisins, although a filled version could not be considered a true croissant. The process starts with mixing the yeast with some milk and flour and leaving it to rise. Next, the yeast is combined with flour, sugar, salt, and the remaining milk, and kneaded by hand or with a mixer until it becomes homogenous. The dough is then left to rise from 2 up to 48 hours under a plastic foil until it doubles in volume. Then, the dough is kneaded once again, rolled into a rectangle, and processed using a technique called turning. A piece of butter is placed in the middle of the rectangle and covered with the sides of the dough to form an envelope. It is then rolled gently with a rolling pin, so the butter is distributed evenly. The dough is turned by 90 degrees, and the process is repeated once again before leaving the dough to rest for 1 hour. At least two more turns — four overall — should be done afterward, which will laminate the dough to its characteristic layered texture. The dough is then cut into triangles, which are rolled from the base towards the top and formed to resemble a crescent. In the end, croissants are glazed with egg yolk and baked in an oven preheated to 180°C/350°F until they become golden brown. The ideal texture of a croissant is crispy and flaky on the outside, and slightly elastic on the inside, with small air pockets called the alveoli. Croissants are usually served for breakfast, plain, perhaps with some coffee; however, nowadays, croissants will often be served with jam and butter, especially outside of France.","France, Europe",4.1,"['PUFF PASTRY (500g/1.1 lb)', '210g (1 2/3 cup + 2 tsp) flour', '85 ml (1/3 cup + 1 tsp) milk', '5g (1 tsp) baker’s yeast', '30g (2 tbsp) caster sugar', '10g (2 tsp) fine salt', '125g (1/2 cup + 2 tsp) butter at room temperature', '1 egg yolk']",5,50min,20min,5h,6h 10min,TasteAtlas,"['First, prepare the puff pastry.

Spaghetti Alla Carbonara,"Carbonara sauce is traditionally prepared with only egg yolks, pecorino Romano cheese, black pepper, and guanciale, the latter being an essential part of the recipe. Pancetta or bacon are often suggested as a substitute in the absence of guanciale, and Parmigiano-Reggiano is recommended as a replacement for pecorino Romano. However, purists claim that any replacements will result in a carbonara sauce that falls flat in comparison to the original. Likewise, true carbonara aficionados consider the recent trend of adding cream to spaghetti alla carbonara tantamount to culinary sacrilege.

Homemade Pork Gyros,"Thin, but juicy meat shavings, garnished with aromatic tzatziki sauce and ripe summer vegetables, and stuffed in a pita bread — that, in its essence, is gyros, one of the most popular street foods of Greece. Calling gyros fast food would not do it justice, since the preparation is lengthy and requires special machinery. The process starts by marinating thin slices of meat — usually pork or lamb, but beef and chicken are also an option — in a blend of olive oil, salt, pepper, vinegar and spices such as thyme, oregano, rosemary and sweet paprika, to name just some. After marinating overnight, the tenderized meat is laid around a vertical skewer in the form of a cone and pressed so no gaps are left. The gyro cone is then placed on the rotisserie grill, and sometimes a thin slice of fat is put on top so it can melt during baking. The skewer rotates slowly in an upright position — hence the name gyros, which means to rotate or to turn — and ...

Once the dough has had time to rise, it is divided and shaped by hand into rough teardrop-shaped pieces that are slapped against the sides of a tandoor, a cylindrical clay oven for baking.

With no cooking involved, the only tool required for the preparation of pesto Genovese is a traditional marble mortar with a wooden pestle. The pesto Genovese is made from only seven ingredients — the garlic and some salt are crushed first, next come the pine nuts, followed by basil leaves and two kinds of Italian cheeses — Parmigiano Reggiano and Pecorino. The preparation is finished by gradually adding some olive oil which binds the paste together. The pesto is most commonly served with pasta, especially trofie or trenette: the first ones are twisted pasta rolls, and the other ones are long pasta stripes similar to linguini.

However, spices like garam masala, ginger, garlic, lemon, chili, turmeric, and much more are typically called for in most recipes. Once the meat is done, it is simmered in butter, tomato, and cream curry that is seasoned with a variety of spices, typically red chili powder, turmeric, cumin, and fenugreek leaves. The gravy can be thickened with cashew paste, and the cream can be used as a garnish instead of being added to the sauce.

Chicken Karaage,"Karaage, a staple of Japanese cuisine, is celebrated for its delightful crunch and tender interior. Although primarily made with chicken, it's not uncommon to find variations made with chicken cartilage, fish, seafood, and vegetables such as gobo or burdock roots.

Still, depending on the recipe, garlic, sesame oil, mirin, oyster sauce, curry powder, egg yolk, and Japanese mayonnaise will also be present. A distinctive feature of karaage is its coating. Traditionally, potato starch is used, creating a light, crispy shell. However, a blend of potato starch and flour is also common. Some regional variations even employ an egg batter for a richer coating. The cooking process involves a double-frying technique.

Lebanese Shawarma,"A close relative to Greek gyros and Turkish döner kebab, shawarma is the ultimate Middle-Eastern version of street food popular both across Lebanon, as well as in other Arabic countries and across the world. Although it may seem simple at first glance, it actually takes up to 2 days to prepare the original Lebanese shawarma. The first step is to mix up a marinade from garlic, olive oil, vinegar, lemon juice and a whole array of spices — usually a special shawarma mix known as The 7 spices which consists of coriander, black pepper, cinnamon, turmeric, cloves, and nutmeg, to name just some. The meat, usually beef, veal, lamb, or chicken, but never pork, is marinated overnight which not only gives it a rich flavor, but also softens the meat due to acids from vinegar and lemon juice. The following step makes the main difference between a homemade shawarma and the one prepared by street vendors. In the latter case, thin slices of marinated meat ...

Dulce De Leche,"This South American caramel spread has developed a cult following in recent years, and it can be found as an ingredient in numerous different recipes, from desserts like cheesecake and crepes to salty snacks such as popcorn. It can also be found in many traditional desserts from Argentina and Uruguay. There are several different ways to make this sauce, and the main difference between them is how long they take. Equally good dulce de leche can be made either from scratch or using shortcuts, so don't hesitate to cook up a batch of your own if you don't have much time on your hands. Traditionally, dulce de leche is made with only two ingredients — milk and sugar which are boiled for seven hours with constant stirring. Additionally, a splash of vanilla can be added to any dulce de leche recipe, as it makes a perfect complement to the flavor of caramelized sugar, while baking soda is often added as it shortens the cooking time.","Argentina, South America",4.2,"['4 cups (1 L) full-fat milk', '1 ¼ cups (250g) sugar', '1/4 tsp baking soda', '1 tsp vanilla']",10,5min,2h,3h,5h 5min,TasteAtlas,"['Add the milk, sugar, and baking soda to a large cooking pan, and stir to combine.', 'Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat and simmer uncovered, occasionally stirring, until caramelized and thickened.

Turkish Döner Kebab Sandwich,"Döner kebap, often simply referred to as döner, is a popular Turkish dish made of seasoned meat cooked on a vertical rotisserie. The meat, typically lamb, but nowadays usually a mix of lamb and beef, is stacked in a cone shape and roasted slowly as it rotates on the spit. As the outer layers of the meat cook, they are sliced off and served while the inner layers continue to cook. Döner kebap is served in a variety of ways. However, the most traditional way is to serve it on a plate with rice or pide bread, tomatoes, and grilled red peppers. Nowadays, it’s not uncommon to find döner kebap made with chicken or served in a sandwich form with French fries and pickles. Döner kebap has gained popularity worldwide and is commonly found in many countries, often with variations to suit local tastes. In Germany, due to a large Turkish diaspora, it has become a dish in its own right, completely diverging from its Turkish roots. There, it’s typically served ...

Hosomaki,"Makizushi, or rolled sushi, is probably the most famous version of the traditional Japanese dish. Also known as norimaki, meaning nori roll, makizushi is a sushi variation typically wrapped in dried seaweed (nori), comprised of vinegared rice and a variety of filling ingredients, such as fish, seafood, eggs, vegetables, and mushrooms. Some other wrapping options include soy paper, cucumber, a thin omelet, or perilla leaves. The dish is made with sushi-meshi, white short-grained Japanese rice that is dressed with a mixture of rice vinegar, sugar, salt, and sometimes, kombu and sake, then cooled to room temperature. After placing a layer of this sticky rice onto a sheet of dried seaweed, filling ingredients are lined in the middle of the rice and rolled with the help of a bendable bamboo mat. Makizushi is traditionally cut into 6 or 8 pieces before serving. There are many subtypes of makizushi, namely futomaki, hosomaki, chumaki, temaki, and uramaki. Futomaki, a large round piece with the usual diameter of 5 to 6 centimeters, is generally wrapped in seaweed and filled with several complementary ingredients. The filling is often vegetarian, consisting of cucumber strips, takenoko bamboo shoots, lettuces, pickled radish, lotus root, tamagoyaki omelet, or kanpyō gourd. The non-vegetarian variations will also include ingredients like tiny fish roe, fish cakes, shrimp, imitation crab meat, and chopped tuna. Also, cheese, lunch meat, bacon, sausage, spicy cooked squid, and kamaboko (a type of cured surimi) are some of the possible additions to the usual ingredients. Hosomaki is a smaller, 2.5 cm (1-inch) in diameter, circular piece, wrapped in nori, usually comprised of only one filling, such as cucumber, tuna, umeboshi paste (pickled ume fruits), or nattō (a dish made with fermented soybeans). Kappamaki, a cucumber-filled hosomaki kind, is traditionally consumed as a palate cleanser between eating raw fish and other kinds of foods. Some other hosomaki variations include tekkamaki (filled with raw tuna), negitoromaki (filled with scallion and chopped tuna), and tsunamayomaki (filled with canned tuna mixed with mayonnaise). Temaki is a cone-shaped, approximately 10 cm long (4-inch) piece, wrapped in nori, which is usually eaten with fingers. Uramaki, or the inside-out roll, is an uncommon makizushi variety in Japan; it was initially invented to suit the Western palate by hiding the nori on the inside of the roll. It consists of two or more fillings, such as avocado, crab meat, tuna, and carrots, wrapped in nori, and then coated in a layer of rice. Occasionally, the rice is covered in roe or some sesame seeds. Sushi is traditionally served with soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger.","Japan, Asia",3.8,"['2 rice cooker cups Japanese short grain rice', '2-inch (5 cm) kombu (dried kelp)', '4 tbsp rice vinegar', '2 tbsp sugar', '1 tsp salt (kosher or sea salt; use half if using table salt)', 'Water', '1 Persian/Japanese cucumber', '6.8 oz (190g) sashimi-grade tuna', '1 box natto (fermented soybean)', '5 sheets nori (seaweed)', 'soy sauce', 'wasabi (optional)', 'sushi ginger (optional)', '¼ cup (60 ml) water', '1 tbsp rice vinegar']",10,1h,1h,-,2h,TasteAtlas,"['Rinse the rice several times to extract as much starch as possible, then soak it in water for at least half an hour.

Steak Au Poivre,"The epitome of fine dining, steak au poivre is considered a classic of French cuisine. A steak is crusted with crushed peppercorns, quickly seared on both sides, and coated in a quick pan sauce. The traditional choice of meat is the tender filet mignon, but other boneless beef cuts are also popular, especially New York strip, ribeye, and sirloin. Although peppercorns are used when preparing both the meat and the sauce, the dish can still qualify as steak au poivre if they are used only in the sauce. Black peppercorns are the standard option, but some recipes also ask for green, red, or white peppercorns, or a combination of the three. The pan sauce is made by deglazing the remaining bits of peppercorns and meat from the pan with cognac, red wine, or stock. Shallots are a common ingredient, while cream is usually added to thicken the sauce, which may be given an optional flambé. If necessary, some butter is added at the end for an extra hit of richness. Steak au poivre is served rare to medium-rare topped with the velvety pan sauce, with a side of either French fries or mashed potatoes, and a salad.","France, Europe",4.2,"['2 steaks, 150-180g (5.3 - 6.3 oz) each and 3 cm (1 ¼ inch) thick', '3 tbsp of crushed black pepper', '4 tbsp of Cognac', '20g (1 tbsp + 1 tsp) butter', '3 tbsp of grape seed oil', '200 ml (3/4 cup + 1 tbsp) fresh cream', 'salt, as needed, to taste']",2,10min,6min,-,16min,TasteAtlas,"['First, salt the steaks on each side.

The process of marinating and then grilling or baking ensures that the pieces become tender, flavorful, and slightly charred on the outside while remaining juicy inside. Chicken tikka is one of the most popular variations known worldwide, but variations can include lamb, fish, paneer (a type of Indian cheese), and even vegetables.

Soufflé Au Chocolat,"Light as a feather, but packed with flavor, chocolate soufflé may seem daunting at first but can be mastered by anyone, no matter how skilled.

Traditional Sernik,"When we speak of cheesecakes, versatility may be one of their main attributes, and Polish sernik is no exception. Traditionally, sernik is made with butter, sugar, eggs, flour and twaróg, Polish cow’s milk cheese with a crumbly texture similar to Italian ricotta. Everything else is a matter of choice — for instance, sernik can have a crust at the bottom, at both the top and the bottom, or have no crust at all. The filling can be based on twaróg cheese or enhanced with fresh, dried or canned fruit. The cake itself can be baked in an oven or prepared raw, while the top can be glazed with lemon icing, chocolate icing, or gelatin, or sprinkled with icing sugar. The variant with a crust is prepared by mixing flour, baking powder, sugar, eggs, and butter into a shortcrust dough. The dough is covered with a filling which consists of twaróg cheese, egg yolks, butter, sugar, potato flour, and egg white snow or meringue, after which the cake is baked in a moderate oven. The variant without the crust is simpler — the ingredients are mixed together, poured into a baking tin, and baked so the center remains juicy and spongy. The no-bake variants use gelatin as a binding agent and make a perfect summer dessert.","Poland, Europe",4.7,"['1 kg twaróg cheese', '250 g butter, softened', '1 ⅓ cup icing sugar', '6 eggs, divided', '1 pack vanilla sugar', '150 ml heavy cream (36%)', '4 tbsp potato flour', 'breadcrumbs or ground almonds, for dusting the baking tin (optional)']",12,10min,1h,-,1h 10min,TasteAtlas,"['Separate the egg whites from the egg yolks.

Pollo A La Brasa,"Pollo a la brasa is a beloved dish in Peru, considered the classic Peruvian dish, surpassing dishes like ceviche. It is considered the national heritage of Peru and is celebrated annually on the third Sunday of July. The preparation begins with creating the marinade—a vital component that infuses the chicken with its characteristic flavors. The marinade typically consists of garlic, cumin, oregano, rosemary, Peruvian aji panca (a type of chili pepper), salt, pepper, soy sauce, vinegar, and beer. Still, it can also include chicha, huacatay, and even pisco. These ingredients are blended together and used to marinate the chicken, which is thoroughly cleaned beforehand. For the best results, the chicken should marinate for several hours, ideally overnight, allowing the spices to deeply penetrate and tenderize the meat.

Cacio E Pepe,"The basis of all Roman pasta dishes, cacio e pepe, is a simple primo piatto consisting of only three main ingredients: pasta, Pecorino Romano, and pepper, with pasta cooking water being the crucial fourth ingredient that's essential to make the sauce. However, although at first glance, a simple dish to make, the technique may take some practice to perfect, since the sauce has to be just right — that is, creamy, silky, and luscious. The secret lies in concentrating starch by cooking pasta in a small amount of water, which is then used to dilute the Pecorino Romano before it's stirred, off heat, together with pasta, ground pepper, and the rest of the water. As a finishing touch, once plated, and before serving, all that is required is a light sprinkling of pepper and, optionally, grated pecorino.","Rome, Italy",4.1,"['400g spaghetti', '180g Pecorino Romano', '8 pinches of roasted and crushed pepper', 'salt, as needed', 'roasted and crushed pepper and Pecorino romano, to sprinkle over the dish, to taste']",4,10min,15min,-,25min,TasteAtlas,"['Roast the peppercorns in a nonstick pan over medium heat, until they start turning translucent.', 'Then, place the peppercorns on a paper towel to cool.

The kneaded dough is divided into portions and rolled into rounds, traditionally baked on a teggia, a shallow and wide terracotta dish. If cooked to perfection, piadina will be crumbly, rough, and interspersed with amber-colored bubbles. The size and thickness of piadina differs from place to place. For example, the one produced in Rimini, characterized by being thinner and larger than an average piadina, is especially noted. Some recipes use olive oil in place of lard to make the piadina lighter, while others make the dough with milk and not water.

The meat is supposed to come from a male lamb not older than 12 months and be cleansed of its nerves, silverskin, and internal fat. Once seasoned, kneaded, and left to rest, the meat is divided into several portions and placed on long and thin iron-cast skewers on which it is barbecued for several minutes.

Chicken Massaman Curry,"More akin to Indian curries than Thai ones, massaman curry is a fusion dish full of Malay and Indian influences, most evident in the use of warm spices. Also, unlike other Thai curries, it has a mild and sweet taste characterized by a deep warmth. There are many preparation methods, depending on the recipe and the ingredients used. However, typically, the preparation starts with stir-frying the coconut milk until it “cracks” — i.e., the oil separates from the milk. At this point, massaman curry paste is added and stir-fried until fragrant. The chicken is added next, along with coconut milk, water, tamarind juice, palm sugar, and fish sauce, then simmered until half-done, when potatoes and onions are added, together with peanuts. Finally, the seasonings are adjusted, more fish sauce to up the saltiness, palm sugar to up the sweetness, and tamarind juice if the stew lacks acid. Variations abound, whether it be using different types of meat, adding additional ingredients, or employing other preparation methods. For example, beef massaman curry, which some claim to be more traditional, needs to cook longer. Also, additional spices are often added, the choice of which depends on the recipe, but most commonly, it’s cardamom, cinnamon, and star anise. Massaman curry is served with a side of rice and ajad, a cucumber relish. Also, it is often sprinkled with Thai mint, cilantro, and chopped chili peppers before serving.","Thailand, Asia",4.9,"['4 bone-in, dark chicken meat pieces', '500 ml (2 cups + 4 tsp) coconut milk', '50g (1.75 oz) massaman curry paste (you can find the recipe on our website!)', '2-3 tbsp finely chopped palm sugar, or brown or granulated sugar.', '1-2 tbsp fish sauce', '2-3 tbsp tamarind juice, you can use pre-made juice or make your own', '1 medium potato or sweet potato, cut into 1.5” (4cm) chunks', '1 small yellow onion, cut into 0.5” (1cm) strips', '¼ cup (35g) roasted whole peanuts', 'steamed rice, for serving']",4,20min,50min,-,1h 10min,TasteAtlas,"['Add a cup (240 ml) of coconut milk to a skillet, then cook it over medium heat until it ""cracks"" — the oil separates.

Authentic Tom Kha Gai,"Tom kha gai is a comforting Thai soup that combines subtle flavors and simple ingredients. It starts with chicken, usually boneless thighs, simmered in coconut milk and chicken stock or water for a rich base. The key ingredient, galangal, similar to ginger, adds a sharp, citrusy, almost piney flavor. Lemongrass and makrut lime leaves are also essential, giving the soup a light, citrusy note. Thai chilies are included to add a bit of heat but are balanced by the savory taste of fish sauce. Mushrooms, like straw or oyster, are thrown in for texture. The soup gets a slight sweetness from palm sugar and a tang from a bit of lime juice, which must be added off heat. Typically served hot, tom kha gai is often garnished with a sprinkle of cilantro or green onions.

Boiled Maine Lobster,"Boiled Maine lobster is a classic seafood dish, particularly revered in New England and especially iconic in the state of Maine, where lobster fishing is a significant part of the local economy and culture. It is both a dish in its own right and a technique, a way of preparing Maine lobster, also known scientifically as Homarus americanus. Maine lobster is prized for its large size, sweet meat, and relatively abundant, easy-to-access meat in the claws and tail. The process of preparing boiled Maine lobster is simple in that it's nothing more than placing whole lobsters into a large pot of boiling, salted water and cooking until done. The cooking time will depend on the size of the lobster and its shell, meaning the larger the lobster and the harder the shell, the more cooking time it will need. Preparing lobster also brings up the dilemma of how to kill the animal humanely, and most scientists suggest placing the lobster in the freezer for half an hour to put it to sleep before plunking ...

Hünkar Beğendi,"Hünkar beğendi, which translates to ""the Sultan liked it"" in Turkish, is a classic Ottoman dish reputedly created for either Sultan Murad IV or Sultan Abdulaziz and became his favorite. This rich and savory meal combines two main components: a creamy eggplant puree and a luscious lamb stew. The puree is made from char-grilled eggplants, which are then peeled to give a smoky flavor. The flesh of the eggplants is pureed and cooked with milk, butter, and flour to form a thick, creamy béchamel-like sauce. Traditionally, it's enriched with kaşar cheese or a similar melty cheese, which adds a delightful depth and richness to the dish. The stew typically features tender pieces of lamb that are slow-cooked with onions, garlic, tomato paste, salt, and pepper. Sometimes tomatoes, green peppers, and different spices such as oregano and thyme can be included. This mixture is simmered until the lamb becomes soft and the flavors are well blended. The eggplant puree is spread on a serving plate as a bed, and the lamb stew is spooned generously over the top. The combination of the smoky, creamy eggplant with the savory, aromatic lamb creates a luxurious dish that's both comforting and sophisticated.

Maguro Nigiri Sushi,"In Japan, the word 'maguro' refers to both tuna and, more specifically, bluefin tuna, a species highly esteemed for sushi and sashimi. When crafting maguro nigiri, skilled sushi chefs carefully shape seasoned sushi rice into ovals, topped with meticulously sliced tuna. Whether it's the robust akami, the sumptuous chutoro, or the decadent otoro, each of these tuna parts is typically sliced against the grain to maximize its texture and taste. A dab of wasabi between the fish and rice adds a gentle yet invigorating heat. Akami, the leanest part of the tuna, boasts a vibrant red color and a firm texture. Its subtly sweet, mild, and clean flavor makes it an ideal choice for nigiri sushi. Chutoro, found between the lean akami and the fatty otoro, strikes a perfect balance with its medium-fat content, offering a melt-in-the-mouth experience that is both rich and gratifying.

Ciorba Radauteana,"Ciorba Radauteana is a traditional Romanian soup known for its rich, tangy flavor, originating from the Radauti area. It is primarily made with chicken, although originally, turkey was used, and parts like the thighs, wings, backs, and necks are preferred to maximize flavor. The soup starts with boiling chicken to create a hearty broth, which is then clarified to remove impurities. Vegetables such as carrots, parsnips, celery, onion, and peppers are commonly added to the broth to cook, while the distinct sour taste is achieved by incorporating vinegar or lemon juice. A key feature of ciorba Radauteana is the creamy thickening mixture, made from a blend of egg yolks, sour cream, and flour, tempered with a bit of the hot broth to prevent curdling before being introduced back into the soup. This process gives the soup a rich, smooth texture.

Baguette,"With its recognizable shape, crispy golden brown exterior, and undeniable charm, a baguette is a world-renowned staple of French cuisine and culture. Extremely prominent in its home country, the bread can be bought nearly everywhere, in one of the numerous boulangeries. This elongated, slender kind of bread is traditionally made solely with wheat flour, water, yeast, and salt. The authentic dough composition is defined by law, and can, besides the essential ingredients, incorporate small amounts of broad bean, soya, or wheat malt flour. Artisanal loaves are sometimes made with bread starter instead of yeast, which enhances the flavor complexity. A typical baguette weighs about 250 grams (8.8 oz), has about 5 or 6 cm (2 inches) in width, and is approximately 65 cm (25.6 inches) long. The preparation starts by mixing the required ingredients and kneading a smooth dough, which is then left to rise for several hours. The risen dough is then shaped into a baguette form, sliced with a knife to acquire the recognizable diagonal scores, and baked in the oven. There are three somewhat distinct variations of the bread: the baguette ordinaire with its crunchy exterior, the baguette moulée, which is industrially made and has a grid marking on the bottom side, and the pallid baguette farinée, which is covered in flour before baking. Slices are often served for breakfast, covered in butter and jam, and dipped into hot chocolate of coffee. It is also commonly served with pâté or cheese and used in the making of sandwiches.","Paris, France",5,"['1 kg (2.2 lbs) flour, plus extra for sprinkling', '18g (1 tbsp) salt', '720 ml (3 cups) water', '10g (2 tsp) yeast']",8,20min,20min,5h 30min,6h 10min,TasteAtlas,"['Thoroughly combine all of the ingredients using a stand mixer with a dough hook.

A few whole chickpeas or pine nuts can also be added as decoration. Hummus ful, on the other hand, is almost identical to hummus bi'tahina, except that it is topped with a fava bean paste.

Fried Chicken,"Fried chicken, which emerged in the USA, is a world-renowned dish involving chicken meat covered in a blend made with flour and seasonings, then cooked in pig lard or vegetable oil. The preparation starts with dividing a whole chicken into portions: the white meat sections include the breast and the wings, while the dark meat parts consist of thighs and legs. The back is usually disposed of, while the breast is often divided into two bits or cut into long strips, the latter version being called chicken fingers. For tenderizing the meat, chicken pieces are sometimes drenched in buttermilk and then coated in a batter made with flour, seasonings, and occasionally milk or eggs. The batter flavoring commonly includes salt, black pepper, and paprika, sometimes accompanied by chili, garlic, or onion powder. Some extra crunchiness is occasionally acquired by applying a layer of breadcrumbs as well. The chicken pieces are traditionally fried in lard; however, vegetable oils, such as canola, peanut, or corn oil, are regularly used as well. There are three techniques one can use for frying chicken – pan-frying, deep-frying, and broasting, which is a method of cooking chicken using a pressure fryer to accelerate the process. Pan-frying, or shallow frying, includes frying the chicken in a solid pan, using a smaller amount of fat. Deep frying, on the other hand, includes submerging the meat entirely in hot fat, using a deep fryer or a similar device. Fried chicken is traditionally served with mashed potato, macaroni and cheese, gravy, corn on the cob, coleslaw, and biscuits, and is sometimes topped with some hot sauce or paprika for extra spiciness. Cooks from different regions and states of the USA have their own special versions of the dish; for example, the ones from Louisiana like to add Cajun flavorings such as garlic and onion powder, paprika, celery salt, and cayenne, while Nashville cooks often coat the cooked chicken in some spicy chile oil or hot sauce breading. Buffalo wings that allegedly originated in upstate New York are coated in hot sauce and butter, whereas hot chicken stands for chicken pieces covered in cayenne pepper paste and lard. Further modifications include popcorn chicken, small boneless chunks which are dipped in batter, and chicken Maryland, bits covered in spices and flour, then served with some cream gravy.","Southern United States, United States Of America",3.8,"['1 (4 lbs/1.8 kg) chicken', '1 cup (240 ml) buttermilk', '2 cups (240g) all-purpose flour for coating', '1 tsp paprika', 'salt and pepper, to taste', '2 qt (1.9 L) vegetable oil for frying']",8,15min,45min,1h,2h,TasteAtlas,"['Cut up the chicken.

Basic Quesadillas,"Ranging from basic to elaborate, quesadilla is a popular Mexican snack that was heartily embraced in the American southwest. The preparation starts with corn or wheat tortillas, which can be homemade or store-bought. Corn tortillas or tortillas de maíz are more common in most parts of Mexico, while wheat tortillas (tortillas de harina or tortillas de trigo) are predominant in the U.S. and northern Mexico. The preparation is simple. Flour, water, salt, and lard or shortening for the wheat variety, are mixed into an elastic dough, which is divided and rolled or pressed into flat discs. Tortillas are cooked shortly on both sides on a cast-iron griddle comal, after which they are ready to become quesadillas. The filling always contains cheese, preferably Mexican varieties such as queso Oaxaca or queso Chihuahua, which melt well when heated. Additional ingredients are virtually endless — fresh or leftover meat, poultry, sausages, seafood, mushrooms, fresh vegetables, potatoes, chili peppers, herbs, and spices. The filling is arranged on half of the tortilla, which is then folded into a half-moon shape and cooked shortly on a comal, so it browns evenly on both sides. The quesadillas are served hot with sauces and condiments like red or green salsa, sour cream, guacamole, fresh vegetables, and lettuce.","Mexico, North America",4.1,"['500g (1.1 lbs) corn flour', '1/4 tbsp salt', '1/4 tbsp salt', '415 ml (1 1/2 cups + 4 tbsp) hot water', '500g (1.1 lbs) cheese (Chihuahua, Oaxaca or Manchego)']",10,30min,30min,30min,1h 30min,TasteAtlas,"['Begin by making the tortillas.

Traditional Pad Thai,"When making pad Thai, one thing to keep in mind is the careful balance of textures and flavors which are synonymous with the dish itself — the chewy and crunchy ingredients for texture, and the balance of sweet, sour, and salty, the three primary flavors of Thai cuisine. First, garlic, tofu, turnip, shallots, and radish are quickly stir-fried in a wok, after which pre-soaked rice noodles are to be incorporated. To make sure the noodle strands separate, they must be vigorously stirred, making sure they are cooked quickly and evenly. If the noodles are still hard, gradually add more water tablespoon by tablespoon. As soon as the noodles are soft and chewy, the sauce ingredients should be added — fish sauce, palm sugar, tamarind, and ground pepper. While stirring continuously, the next ingredient to be added is dried shrimp. Once all the ingredients have been well combined, check and adjust the seasoning. The noodles are then pushed aside to make room for the egg, which must be quickly scrambled into the noodles as soon as it is added. Bean sprouts and chopped chives are added at the end and stir-fried briefly, so they preserve their color and crunchy texture. The finished meal is plated and sprinkled with crushed peanuts and cracked pepper. Chives, a wedge of lime or lemon, and the remaining bean sprouts are placed on top as a garnish, and additional condiments — fish sauce, sugar, chili pepper, and salt — should always be on hand.","Thailand, Asia",4.2,"['1/2 quartered banana flower, lengthwise', '2 cups (200g) bean sprouts', '5-6 cut Chinese chives - green parts', '1/3 cup (25g) dried shrimp', '1 egg', '1 tbsp fish sauce', '3 cloves chopped garlic', '1/2 tsp ground dried chili pepper', 'ground pepper', '1 lime', '2 tbsp toasted and crushed peanuts', '2 tbsp chopped preserved turnip', '1 chopped shallot', '2 tbsp sugar', '2 tbsp tamarind paste', '1/2 packet Thai rice noodles', '3 tbsp cooking oil', '1/3 cup (65g) julienne pressed tofu']",2,30min,10min,-,40min,TasteAtlas,"['Start by preparing the ingredients.

Classic Ceviche,"Fresh and fragrant, ceviche is a simple dish that requires no cooking, although it relies heavily on the freshness of its ingredients. It is made with raw fish fillets cut into bite-sized squares, stripes, or thin slices, and marinated in lime or, rarely, lemon juice. The acids from the citrus denature the fish proteins in the same way as it is done by cooking, so the fish changes its color from pink to white, but without being exposed to heat. The best choice for making ceviche is sea fish with firm white flesh, such as sea bass, striped bass, grouper, sole, or flounder. Still, local variations of this dish can be prepared with other seafood such as seashells, shrimps, and octopus, even with dried fish. After marinating the fish, fresh, thinly sliced onions are added, along with some fresh herbs such as cilantro, and finely chopped chili peppers like ají limo or amarillo. All the ingredients are combined gently, and the ceviche is usually served cold with a side of boiled sweet potato and corn. Ceviche is often accompanied by tiger’s milk – the remaining marinade poured into a small glass, which is used both as an aphrodisiac and a cure for a hangover.","Peru, South America",4.3,"['720g (25 oz) fresh fish fillets (white fish such as corvina, sea bass, sole, flounder, grouper)', '12 Peruvian limes (Key limes will also do)', '2 red ají limo peppers', '2 red onions', '450g (16 oz) cooked sweet potato', '225g (8 oz) cooked corn', 'salt, to taste', 'fresh cilantro, to taste']",4,30min,-,20min,50min,TasteAtlas,"['First, prepare the ingredients.

Turkish Baklava,"This famous dessert consists of three essential components – phyllo dough, a nutty filling, and syrup. As opposed to the simplicity of the ingredients, making the dough is a difficult endeavour that takes some practice to master. Many recipes today will skip the dough-making process entirely and opt for pre-made phyllo sheets instead. Today, there are numerous different types of baklava with different fillings, but the Turkish original uses pistachios with no added flavorings or spices. Other nutty fillings are used depending on the region, such as walnuts and hazelnuts, which are then paired with spices like cinnamon or cardamom.

Turkish recipes use lamb or beef, while European versions often incorporate pork as well, seasoned with onion, garlic, and spices. After stuffing, the rolls are simmered, baked, or steamed in a lidded pot. The dish is usually served warm, with mashed potatoes and bread. It is especially popular in the winter months as a lunch or dinner and is commonly served during the holidays and for special occasions. A multitude of variations includes the Romanian sarmale with ground pork and caramelized onions, the Polish gołąbki, consisting of cabbage leaves and mixed pork and beef, and the Hungarian töltött káposzta, which is made with sweet or sauerkraut cabbage leaves and a mixture of pork, eggs, and rice.

Original Raclette,"The raclette dish is traditionally prepared by heating the raclette cheese either in front of a fire or by a special machine, then scraping off the melted layer onto diners' plates. It's commonly served with boiled potatoes, pickled onions, cornichons (small pickled gherkins), and sometimes dried meats like prosciutto or ham, allowing the melted cheese to be the star of the meal. Nowadays, raclette parties have become popular, where small tabletop grills are used to melt slices of raclette cheese individually. These grills also have a griddle top where guests can cook meats and vegetables to accompany the cheese. This social dining experience emphasizes communal eating and allows guests to customize their plates with various accompaniments to the rich, melted cheese.","Canton Of Valais, Switzerland",4.5,"['½ wheel of Raclette du Valais AOP (approx. 2.4 to 2.5 kg/5.3 - 5.5 lbs)', '1.6 kg (3.5 lbs) small boiled potatoes', 'pickles (as desired)', 'pearl onions (optional)']",8,10min,20min,-,30min,TasteAtlas,"['Position a half wheel of Raclette du Valais AOP beneath a raclette oven, ensuring the cheese is maintained at a minimum distance of 6 centimeters from the heat source.', 'As soon as the surface of the cheese begins to melt, use a knife and gently scrape the softened layer onto a pre-warmed plate.

Chicken Karē Raisu,"Despite its origins being rooted in Indian curry, which was introduced to Japan by the British, Japanese curry has evolved to suit local tastes, resulting in a thicker, milder sauce compared to its Indian counterpart. The curry sauce typically includes a variety of meats (such as chicken, beef, or pork) and vegetables (onions, carrots, and potatoes), and it's thickened with a roux, which is a mixture of flour, fat, and spices. The sauce is often slightly sweet and not as spicy as other Asian curries, making it particularly popular among children and adults alike. Karē raisu is often served with additional ingredients or garnishes, such as pickled vegetables or hard-boiled eggs.

Tandoori Chicken,"Named after the clay oven in which it’s baked, tandoori chicken is one of the best-known dishes of Indian cuisine, that, because it’s hard to imitate without using a tandoor oven, is typically an eat-out dish. The preparation starts by removing the skin, then halving or quartering the chicken which is then marinated twice. The first marinade is made up of salt and an acid component, typically lime juice whereas the second one is yogurt-based. Garam masala, Kashmiri red chili powder, garlic, ginger, cumin, cayenne pepper, and other spices are added to the second marinade, although the acid-based marinade can also include some, most commonly red chili powder. Once marinated for a few hours, the chicken is skewered and baked in the traditional clay oven tandoor for no more than 15 minutes. The finished chicken is characterized by an orangey-yellow hue — not red, which is often achieved by adding red food color to the marinade — and a crispy, charcoaled exterior that hides succulent, flavorful, smoked meat. Traditionally, tandoori chicken is served with onion rings, lime wedges, and Indian flatbread naan.","Punjab, India",4.7,"['1 whole chicken, without skin, approx. 1600-1700 grams', '1 ½ tbsp lime juice', '1 tsp red chilli powder', '1 tsp salt', '½ cup yoghurt (dahi)', '1 tbsp garlic (lasan) paste', '1 tbsp ginger (adrak) paste', '½ tsp black salt (kala namak)', '1 tsp garam masala powder', '½ tsp dried fenugreek leaves', 'refined oil for basting']",4,20min,45min,-,1h 5min,TasteAtlas,"['With a knife make two incisions, to the bone, on the breast, and drumsticks.', 'Prepare the first marinade by combining all of the ingredients and rub it into the chicken, then leave to marinate for an hour.

Milanesa,"Similar to the Austrian wiener schnitzel, the Italian cotoletta alla Milanese, and the Japanese tonkatsu, the Argentinian milanesa is also a breaded cutlet shallow-fried in oil. The cutlet typically comes either from the round or from the eye of the round, which are lean cuts, meaning they have less fat, marbling, and sinew when compared to most other cuts of beef. Besides beef, milanesa can also be prepared with veal, pork, or be made vegetarian by using soy cutlets or eggplant instead. The first step when preparing milanesa is to prepare the meat, which means removing any fat or sinew to get as clean of cutlets as possible, which are then pounded with a mallet until a half a centimeter thick. The cutlets are then first dipped typically in a mixture of beaten eggs, chopped garlic, parsley, salt, and pepper, but, depending on the recipe, this mixture can also include mustard. Once soaked in the egg mixture, the cutlets are dredged in breadcrumbs and then shallow-fried in a pan until golden. The milanesa should be served warm, with just a drizzle of lemon juice and a side of mashed potatoes or fries. In Argentina, they also have variations on the basic milanesa, such as caballo, which is milanesa topped with an egg and milanesa a la napolitana, which has a topping of tomato salsa, ham, and mozzarella cheese.","Argentina, South America",5,"['2 lbs (900g) beef round, thinly sliced (1 cm thick/ 1/2-inch thick)', '2 eggs, beaten', '2 cups (250g) breadcrumbs', '2 garlic cloves, chopped', '3 tbsp parsley, chopped', 'salt', 'black pepper, ground', 'vegetable oil (for frying)']",4,25min,10min,-,35min,TasteAtlas,"['Slice the beef into 1 cm (1/2-inch) thick cutlets.', 'Cut off all the fat and the sinew to get as clean of as cutlets as possible.', 'Tenderize the cutlets with a mallet until half a centimeter (1/5-inch) thick.', 'Whisk the eggs with chopped garlic, chopped parsley, salt, and pepper.', 'Drench the cutlets in the egg mixture, then let them soak in it in the refrigerator for 45 minutes.', 'Heat the oil over medium-high heat until it reaches 170°C/340°F.', 'Coat the cutlets in breadcrumbs and fry them on both sides for a few minutes, then place them on paper towels to drain.', 'Serve warm, with some of the following: French fries, mashed potatoes, green salad, potato salad, or roasted peppers.']",https://www.tasteatlas.com/milanesa/recipe,https://www.tasteatlas.com/images/recipes/fd347b96361146f9a69719881e22209a.jpg?mw=910

Next, the tentsuyu sauce is prepared by boiling Japanese fish stock dashi, rice wine mirin, soy sauce, and sugar, and simmering until slightly thickened. The final and the most sensitive step is the tempura. The shrimps or prawns are shelled and deveined, while the vegetables are cut into thin slices.

Apfelstrudel,"To make the famous Viennese apfelstrudel, two things must be perfect — the dough and the filling. While the type of dough should be either regular strudel pastry, puff pastry, or shortcrust pastry, store bought pastry is also a good substitute. In addition to spices, the original recipe calls for hazelnuts to be added to the apple filling, but these can be either substituted with a different kind of nut or left out entirely.

The Original Spaghetti Alla Matriciana,"To prepare the famous Amatriciana pasta sauce, two ingredients are essential: pecorino cheese and a cured Italian pork jowl salami known as guanciale, a traditional ingredient for which there is considered to be no proper substitute. Guanciale is known to have a deeper, richer, sweet-savory pork flavor than both Italian pancetta or bacon, and due to its high fat-to-meat ratio, it has a meltingly tender texture. Some recipes also advise adding onion or even garlic to Amatriciana, which has become a fairly common practice both in Italy and abroad as it makes the sauce a little sweeter. However, locals from Amatrice, the birthplace of this pasta sauce, consider this a serious offense.

Modern adaptations also replace sour cream with yogurt, whipped cream, condensed milk, buttercream, or custard, while the layers are commonly flavored with cinnamon and ginger powder. Even though making medovik seems like a long and laborious task, on average, it only takes about two hours to complete.

Appeltaart,"Appeltaart, commonly known as the Dutch apple pie, has been a staple of Dutch food culture for centuries. The filling consists of thickly chopped apples and raisins flavored with fragrant warm spices such as cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg. A classic Dutch apple pie is made with Golden Reinette apples which are, not coincidentally, the most cultivated apple variety in the Netherlands. Because Dutch apple pies are baked in deep springform pans, their crust is typically much thicker and crisper compared to other world-famous pies. For example, unlike Dutch apple pies, American pies have flaky or shortening-based crusts that fully enclose the apple filling. On the other hand, French apple pies tend to have puff pastry or cookie-like crusts.

Żurek,"Żurek is a traditional Polish soup known for its distinctive sour flavor from a fermented rye flour or oatmeal starter. This soup is an integral part of Polish cuisine and is especially popular during Easter celebrations, though it is enjoyed year-round. The fundamental component of żurek is the fermented rye flour starter, known as ""zakwas."" This starter is made by mixing rye flour with water and allowing it to ferment for several days. The fermentation process creates the characteristic sour taste of the soup. To make zakwas, rye flour is mixed with water and sometimes a piece of rye bread crust to aid fermentation. It is left at room temperature for 3-5 days, during which natural bacteria and wild yeast ferment the mixture. The soup base is typically a meat or vegetable broth. Other typical ingredients include a white sausage (biała kiełbasa), which is often pre-cooked separately, smoked bacon or other meats, and vegetables like carrots, celery, and onions. Potatoes are a common ingredient, often diced and added to the soup before zakwas. Garlic, marjoram, bay leaves, allspice, and peppercorns are common seasonings used to enhance the flavor, while sliced or halved hard-boiled eggs are frequently added just before serving. Żurek is often served in a bread bowl made from a round loaf of rye bread, adding to the rustic and hearty appeal of the dish.

Şiş Tavuk,"These marinated chicken skewers are a staple of Middle Eastern cuisine, present in Turkey, Azerbaijan, Lebanon, Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Iraq, and Israel.

This marinade is more typical of Turkish cuisine, while in other countries where şiş tavuk is prepared different spice blends are used. For example, in Lebanon sumac is added, in Iran saffron, and in Marocco ginger and paprika. Ideally, the meat would be marinated overnight in a refrigerator, but even two to four hours will do. The marinated meat is threaded onto skewers and grilled until caramelized on the outside but juicy and cooked throughout on the inside. While grilling, the meat should be turned often and brushed with the leftover marinade, so it retains moisture and to prevent burning. Şiş tavuk can be served either with side dishes like vegetables, rice, and even French fries or in a sandwich.

Syrniki,"Syrniki, a beloved traditional Eastern European and particularly popular Russian breakfast treat, stand out for their unique combination of a rich texture and sweet flavor. These are not your typical pancakes found in Western cuisine, but rather, they are fried cheese pancakes. The star ingredient in syrniki is tvorog, a type of fresh cheese that can be compared to farmer's cheese or quark. It's similar to ricotta but denser and with a tangier taste, adding a distinct flavor to the dish. The cheese is mixed with eggs, flour, and often a bit of sugar and salt to form a thick batter. Additional flavorings like vanilla or citrus zest can be added for extra flavor. The mixture is then shaped into flat cakes or patties, which are coated in flour to give them a light crust. These patties are pan-fried in oil or butter until they are golden brown on both sides. Syrniki are traditionally served for breakfast or as a dessert. They are typically topped with sour cream, jam, honey, or fresh berries, which complement the pancakes' creamy texture and mild sweetness. Another popular topping is apple sauce, which adds a nice contrast to the richness of the cheese.

Classic Gaziantep Katmer,"Rich, indulgent, juicy, and flaky at the same time, the Turkish katmer is, without a doubt, a dish you should skip if you are on a diet. The preparation of this satiable dessert starts with kneading some flour, salt, and water into a soft dough: the process is similar to the one used for flatbread (yufka) or baklava, but the main difference is that generous amounts of oil are used. The dough needs to sit in oil under a wet cloth for one hour, and what happens next is a matter of skill and experience. Flipped in the air and stretched manually until it becomes paper-thin, the dough is spread over a working surface and folded into a traditional form of an envelope. Next, crushed pistachios, sugar, and kaymak (Turkish clotted cream) are sprinkled lavishly on top, and the dough is once again folded into an envelope, edges sealed, and top brushed with more oil or ghee. During baking in a hot oven, the oils from kaymak and pistachio blend together with melted sugar, creating a unique flavor. The most famous katmer is made in Gaziantep, where it is filled with kaymak and pistachios as described. On the other hand, in the Afyon province, they fill katmer with poppy seed paste.

Kokoretsi,"Kokoretsi is a traditional Greek dish that uses lamb or goat offal, including the liver, lungs, heart, kidneys, and sweetbreads, cut into small pieces and wrapped in intestines that are then roasted. The intestines are thoroughly cleaned and inverted to ensure cleanliness. The offal is seasoned with salt and garlic, but the seasoning can also include herbs like rosemary and oregano, lemon zest, pepper, and olive oil. Caul fat, a lacy membrane encasing the organs, can also be used to wrap the offal before the intestines for added moisture and flavor. The prepared skewer is roasted slowly over embers or in an oven. Initially, it is cooked at a moderate temperature to ensure the offal is cooked through; then, the temperature is increased (or the kokoretsi is placed closer to the embers) to brown and crisp the outer layer. The cooking process usually takes several hours, with the kokoretsi being basted with its own juices or additional olive oil to keep it moist. Kokoretsi is typically served hot, cut into thick slices directly from the skewer, often accompanied by lemon wedges and garnished with fresh herbs.

Naleśniki,"Similar to French crêpe, Polish naleśniki are thin pancakes meant to be filled and rolled and can be either sweet or savory, depending on the filling. The batter for the pancakes is made with flour, eggs, milk, water (preferably carbonated), and a pinch of salt, while optional ingredients include sugar, and oil or butter, in which case the pan for frying usually does not have to be greased. Typical sweet fillings include jams, preserves, fruit, and cheese, while savory naleśniki can be filled with cheese, meat, mushrooms, or sauerkraut. Once filled, the pancake is rolled or folded into a triangle and can be, in some cases, either shortly fried until golden or baked in the oven.

Paella Mixta,"Consisting of saffron-flavored rice accompanied by an array of different ingredients, including meat, seafood, and vegetables, paella got its name from a broad and not very deep skillet typically employed in the preparation. The cooking process begins by either browning the meats and the seafood or making a sofrito from onions, garlic, and paprika. The vegetables are then shortly fried until tender. Next, rice, proteins, and liquid are added to the skillet and usually seasoned with saffron. Once done, the dish is allowed to rest for a few minutes prior to serving. Paella is customarily served in the pan (paella or paellera) and consumed with wooden spoons, without the plates. The most prominent out of the numerous modifications of the dish is called paella Valenciana, made with chicken and rabbit meat, several types of beans, and, occasionally, snails. Besides this Valencian dish, which was initially cooked outdoors, over a fire sustained by vine or orange branches, there is another type of paella out there, and it includes shrimp, fish, and clams. A blend of these two variations is known as paella mixta and incorporates a number of different ingredients, such as chicken, mussels, shrimps, and sausage.","Spain, Europe",4.3,"['1 tsp thread saffron', '2 tsp smoked paprika', '2 medium onions, chopped', '2 red bell pepper, chopped', '2 tomatoes, chopped', '8 piquillo peppers, sliced', '4 garlic cloves, chopped', '3 chicken thighs, skinned and cut into 2 inch pieces, seasoned with salt and pepper', '12 large shrimp, peeled', '12 mussels (or clams)', '1 lb (450g) Spanish cooking sausage, cut into 1 inch/2.5 cm pieces', '8 tbsp extra virgin olive oil', 'Spanish sea salt and pepper', '2 cups (400g) bomba rice', '6 cups (1500 ml) chicken broth', 'lemon wedges']",4,30min,50min,10min,1h 30min,TasteAtlas,"['In a covered pot, heat the stock, paprika, and saffron.', 'Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil to the paella pan, and cook the chicken and the chorizo for about 5 minutes, until slightly browned.

Fudgy Brownies,"Brownies are a chocolate-rich dessert, as the name might imply, and are incredibly easy to prepare. Melted chocolate and butter are mixed with sugar, butter, eggs, cocoa, and flour into a smooth batter. Once the batter is baked, it is cut into squares or bars. There are countless brownie recipes with any number of variations, however even the most complicated is still relatively easy to make. There are two types of brownie — a fudgy brownie made with less flour, and a spongy, cake-like brownie with more flour and longer baking time.

Onigiri,"Whether enjoyed on its own or as a part of a bento box, onigiri is the quintessential Japanese snack that does not require any tools to make. Simply put, onigiri is a Japanese rice ball, that is typically filled with various ingredients such as salmon, katsuobushi (dried, fermented, and smoked skipjack tuna), umeboshi (sour Japanese plum), and tsukudani (small pieces of seafood, meat or seaweed that has been simmered in soy sauce and mirin). However, an onigiri does hot have to be filled at all. Also, unlike in the case of sushi, the rice for onigiri is just cooked Japanese short-grain rice, which is shaped by hand, typically into balls or triangles. Once assembled and filled, onigiris are often wrapped with nori, but in case they are grilled (yaki onigiri), they are not wrapped but brushed with either soy sauce or white miso as they are broiling or grilling.","Japan, Asia",4.7,"['1 tsp salt', '1 cup (240 ml) water', '1 cup (200g) warm cooked rice', '4 tsp cooked flaked fresh salmon or flaked canned salmon', '2 sheets yakinori, halved']",4,30min,-,-,30min,TasteAtlas,"['Dissolve salt in a cup of water.', 'Wet your hands with salted water, then take a 1/4 cup (50g) of rice and shape it into a thick triangle.', 'Make a small indent in the center of the triangle with your finger and put inside a teaspoon of salmon and seal it by tapping the rice with your wet hands.', 'Now, make three more onigiris this way.', 'Dry your hands and wrap each onigiri with nori, so that one point of the triangle is peeking out.', 'Eat immediately or store for later.']",https://www.tasteatlas.com/onigiri/recipe,https://www.tasteatlas.com/images/recipes/52d092c5be224215aea73b00cabf0900.jpg?mw=910
Classic Tonkatsu,"For anyone who has ever tried preparing Wiener schnitzel, the preparation of tonkatsu will be an easy task, since it is the same in most steps. The process begins with picking the meat — in Japan, you can specifically ask for a tonkatsu cut, and in other parts of the world, a simple tenderloin or a boneless pork cutlet around 1 centimeter (1/2-inch) thick will do. The finest Japanese tonkatsu is allegedly made from a black pig called kurobuta from Kagoshima Prefecture in Southern Japan. The meat needs to be bashed lightly to become more tender and seasoned with salt and pepper. It is then rolled in white flour, whisked egg, and panko — Japanese breadcrumbs made from dried bread. Tonkatsu is fried on each side in deep hot oil for 3-5 minutes until it reaches golden color. Then, it is drained on a paper towel, which helps the crust remain extra crispy. Usually, tonkatsu is cut into strips before serving to make it easier to eat using chopsticks, ...

Traditional Cannoli Siciliani,"Sicilian cannoli are made by deep-frying pastry dough shells in lard or vegetable oil and then filling them with sweetened ricotta cream, which is typically flavored with orange blossom water and mixed with candied fruit. However, no matter what the flavorings happen to be, traditional cannoli recipes insist on using only fresh sheep's ricotta for the filling. Cannoli are relatively simple to make; still, frying the pastry shells does require a certain degree of skill. The ingredients for the pastry shells are kneaded into a smooth dough and flattened into a very thin layer, either with a rolling pin or by passing it through a pasta machine. The dough is then cut into ovals, wrapped around a stainless steel or aluminum cannoli tube, and deep-fried until nice and crispy.

Traditional Calzone With Ricotta And Cracklings,"A calzone is typically an oven-baked, folded pizza of Neapolitan cuisine. The dough is traditionally a bread dough made with flour, yeast, salt, and water.

Initially, the fillings were quite frugal and included ingredients like greaves, pork lard, or pork scraps, and ricotta, seasoned with salt and pepper. However, with time the fillings have diversified to include tomatoes, which are now a must in almost every calzone recipe; as well as mozzarella, parmesan, basil, and various types of salami, though the preferred choice is Neapolitan salami (salame Napoli).

Reuben Sandwich,"Making a Reuben sandwich is simple for any kitchen novice — quality ingredients are key, but almost zero kitchen skills are required. To start, spread the bottom side of a rye bread slice with butter and its face-up with Russian dressing, then top it first with corned beef, followed by Swiss cheese and sauerkraut. Cover with the other bread slice — dressing side down, buttered side up — and grill in a pan on both sides until the bread is crispy and golden and the cheese has melted. In different parts of the United States and Canada, you will come across versions of the Reuben sandwich, most of which replace the corned beef with other kinds of meats or fish. The Montreal Reuben has Montreal-style smoked meat instead of corned beef, while in Minnesota and Ohio they have Walleye Reuben which is made with walleye fish.

Classic Gyūdon,"Although it is described as fast food, gyūdon can hardly be considered junk food. This satiable meal, one of the most popular Japanese dishes, is consisted of fresh, thin-cut beef which is simmered in a marinade made of soy sauce, sake, rice wine mirin, sugar, and onions. Sometimes, the meat is sautéed shortly before adding the liquid ingredients, but the end result is always the same — tender, bite-sized pieces of beef topping a portion of white rice soaked in savory-sweet sauce. The sauce is sometimes made with ginger and dashi – a simple broth made from water, dried kombu (kelp) and dried bonito flakes – which gives this dish a richer flavor. Since dashi is an essential part of miso soup, many gyūdon eateries offer a complimentary bowl of miso with every portion of gyūdon, or they sell it at a very reasonable price.

Sometimes, sambal ulek is enriched with vinegar of lime juice and serves as a base for other, more complex sambals. Those are made with either fresh or fried vegetables — chili peppers in the first place, onions, Asian shallots, garlic, eggplants, and tomatoes seasoned with vinegar, lime juice, lemongrass, sugar, soy sauce and terasi — fermented shrimp paste or powder.

If you ask any Key lime pie purist, adding green food coloring is a major faux pas, so if you’re ever served such a pie, keep moving. The other original ingredient is sweetened condensed milk which should not be replaced with milk or cream if the dessert is to be labeled authentic.

Traditional Brazilian Feijoada,"Just like the Sunday roast in the Western world, feijoada is a staple weekend dish in Brazil prepared to feed large families and groups of friends in an economical, yet delicious manner. This black bean stew is brewed slowly with a mélange of salted and smoked beef and pork products, and it is seasoned with sautéed onions, garlic, and bay leaf. Traditionally, feijoada was made with the cheapest cuts of meat such as pork feet, tails, snouts, ears and beef tongue, while smoked beef, bacon, pork ribs, and sausages were introduced later, as the dish developed. As for the preparation, it is a lengthy process which starts a day ahead — the first step is to desalt the salted meat products by soaking them in water, changing it every few hours. If dried black beans are used, they need to be soaked overnight as well. The meat and beans are then cooked together slowly until they become tender, and the surrounding liquid becomes gelatinous and black. Sautéed onions and garlic are stirred in at the very end, and after 10 to 15 minutes of simmering the feijoada is ready to be served. Quite often, an aperitif called caldinho de feijão is offered before the feijoada itself, and it is basically a bean broth served in shot glasses. The feijoada comes to the table accompanied by cooked rice, sautéed cabbage or kale, fresh orange wedges and farofa, toasted manioc flour enhanced with butter and onions. Finally, the feijoada is washed down with a can of ice cold Brazilian beer, a glass of sugarcane brandy cachaca, or a caipirinha cocktail.","Brazil, South America",3.6,"['200g (7 oz) dried beef', '200g (7 oz) salted or smoked pork ribs', '200g (7 oz) salted pork feet', '100g (3.5 oz) salted pork tails', '100g (3.5 oz) salted pork ears', '150g (5.3 oz) smoked or salted pork loin', '100g (3.5 oz) paio sausage', '100g (3.5 oz) Portuguese sausage', '100g (3.5 oz) smoked beef tongue', '50g (1.75 oz) bacon', '900g (2 lbs) black beans', '2 cups (480 ml) oil', '200g (7 oz) chopped onion', '100g (3.5 oz) chopped garlic', '6 bay leaves', '2 oranges, cut in half']",6,24h,2h 5min,-,1d 2h,TasteAtlas,"['Clean the salted meat thoroughly by removing the excess fat and hairs.

Spanakopita With Homemade Phyllo,"The traditional Greek savory pie, spanakopita, although time-consuming to prepare, is incredibly versatile since it can be served as a snack, an appetizer, or a light main course if paired, for example, with a salad.

The filling typically consists of spinach, feta, and eggs, but can also often include onions, dill, parsley, spring onions, lemon, and different kinds of greens and herbs, depending on the recipe. It can also include grains like rice, barley, or tarhana which have the role of soaking up the excess liquid from the filling as the pie bakes. Spanakopita can be assembled one of three ways: in a baking dish, as a layered pie, and as rolls which are then formed into a snail-like shape, or as triangles, perfect for serving as hors-d'oeuvres.

Kedah Laksa,"Laksa is a versatile savory dish that originated in Southeast Asia, consisting of broth, noodles, and a variety of other ingredients, such as meat, seafood, and vegetables. Generally speaking, it is made by cooking a flavored broth, then cooking, frying or blanching the chosen ingredients, and finally assembling the dish in a bowl, with the addition of some noodles and toppings. Laksa is often prepared and sold in hawker centers across the region. There are two main kinds of the dish, depending on the type of broth being used as the base — curry laksa and asam laksa. Curry laksa is a creamy, curry-based dish usually made with coconut milk, rice noodles, prawns, chicken, bean sprouts, fish cakes, and eggs. The commonly used spices include ginger, galangal, turmeric, cloves, and chilies. Curry laksa is often served with some sambal chili paste and laksa leaves, also known as Vietnamese coriander or Vietnamese mint. The numerous varieties include laksa lemak, laksam, Bogor laksa, Cibinong laksa, Thai laksa, and Katong laksa. Asam laksa has a sour flavor and is made with a fish and tamarind-based broth accompanied by an array of thinly sliced vegetables, such as onions, chilies, cucumber, pineapple, and mint. It is served with rice noodles and topped with some prawn paste. Versions of asam laksa include Penang laksa, Kedah laksa, Perlis laksa, Medan laksa, and Kuala Kangsar laksa. The combination of the two previously described main kinds of laksa makes for a third type, which includes both coconut milk and tamarind, fish, chicken, and prawn.

Surf And Turf With Lobster And Beef Tenderloin,"Rather than a specific dish, surf and turf is more of a concept which suggests serving red meat and seafood on the same plate. The meat — usually tender cuts of beef such as tenderloin, sirloin, or strip steak — is cooked medium-rare or medium on a grill or in a grilling pan. Marinating can be done before grilling to infuse the meat with flavors of preferred herbs and spices, but is not obligatory. On the other hand, the common choice of seafood are crustaceans, such as lobster, shrimp, and prawns, which can be grilled, oven-baked, steamed or fried. The rule is to cook the seafood after the meat since the meat needs to rest shortly before being served. Some butter or a dollop of sauce is often placed on top of the steak, and the usual sides for a classic surf and turf include steamed vegetables, mushrooms, French fries or potato chips.","United States Of America, North America",4.1,"['2 cloves garlic', '2 tsp + 2 tbsp olive oil, divided', '1/4 cup fresh parsley', '3 tbsp green onions', '2 tbsp fresh thyme', '2 tsp lemon peel', '1/2 tsp salt', '1/4 tsp pepper', '1/8 tsp cayenne pepper', '1/2 cup butter, softened', '1 cup soft bread crumbs', '1/4 cup butter, melted', '4 lobster tails (8-10 oz each)', '4 beef tenderloin steaks (4 oz each)', '4 tsp pepper, coarsely ground']",4,25min,15min,-,40min,TasteAtlas,"['Mince the garlic and heat 2 tsp olive oil in a small skillet.

Classic Moules-Frites,"England has fish and chips, the USA has burgers and fries, and Belgium has moules-frites, which are the ultimate fast food – it only takes five minutes to get them ready. The first step is to take fresh mussels, wash them quickly in cold water to remove the sand, and place them in a hot pot with some butter and vegetable broth. The pot is then closed with a lid, and the mussels are shaken vigorously a few times in order to be cooked evenly. A portion usually ranges between 1 and 1,5 kilos per person, and the most appreciated mussels in Belgium come from the river Schelde, which connects western Belgium to the Netherlands and the North Sea. As for the potatoes, high-starch varieties such as the local Bintje variety are the best for frying. The potatoes are peeled, washed and dried, and cut into thin sticks. The trick to making them extra crispy is in frying them twice. First round is done in medium heated oil until the fries become limp. Next step is to drain the frites and fry them again at a higher temperature until they are golden on the outside. The most common condiment to moules-frites is mayonnaise, which can easily be prepared by whisking some mustard with egg yolks, slowly adding the oil until it begins to emulsify, and seasoning with vinegar, lemon juice, salt, and pepper.","Belgium, Europe",4.1,"['500g (1.1 lbs) mussels', '2 tbsp butter', '1 onion, finely diced', '2 cloves garlic, crushed', '1/2 cup (120 ml) white wine', '1 lemon juice', '1 1/4 cups (300 ml) evaporated milk', '1 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped', '900g (2 lbs) potatoes (if possible, Bintje variety)', 'beef fat']",4,15min,20min,-,35min,TasteAtlas,"['Scrub the mussels and scrape them with a sharp knife to remove the ""beard"".', 'Heat the butter in a large saucepan and sauté onion and garlic until soft.

Challah,"Typically a special occasion only bread, served for Shabbat and other holidays, challah is made with leavened egg dough which is usually shaped like a braid, but other shapes such as a round, a key, a ladder, a hand, a triangle, or an oblong are also traditional. Challah can also be classified depending on what ingredients are used. The challah of Ashkenazi Jews, considered to be the original version of the bread, will include eggs, oil, either poppy or sesame seeds, honey, and, if made specifically for Rosh Hashanah, raisins. Because sugar and eggs were scarce in North Africa and the Middle East, Sephardi Jews, season their challah with spices such as anise, caraway, cardamom, coriander, and za’atar. The bread is also enriched with either olive oil or nut oils, and orange blossom and rose water are also often added, as well as saffron and raisins. Mizrahi Jews, on the other hand, prepare a very plain challah with just a speck of sugar and with no fat. This version, which can be seasoned with spices, is often called water challah and is different from others in that it has a very crisp crust, similar to that of a baguette. Although challah dough is classified as enriched (over 10% fat), because kosher laws do not allow eating meat and dairy in the same meal, oil and eggs are the only fat in the dough. The amount of sugar or other sweeteners such as honey is also high, which is why this bread is baked at lower temperatures, only up to 180°C, so the exteriors are soft and golden-brown and not burned. The dough is typically twice proven, once when kneaded, and once when shaped. It is brushed either before going into the preheated oven (meanwhile, it's been covered with a damp cloth during the entire proving time) or right after it's been shaped so that the surface does not dry out during proving. As the last step, challah is generously sprinkled with either poppy or sesame seeds, or a combination of both, then baked depending on size, anywhere from 30-40 minutes to up to an hour.","Israel, Asia",5,"['2 tbsp dry yeast', '500ml lukewarm water', '100g sugar', '4 eggs, beaten, plus 2 yolks or 1 whole egg for glazing', '1 tbsp salt', '125ml vegetable oil', 'about 1.3kg all-purpose flour', 'poppy or sesame seeds (optional)']",12,1h 20min,40min,-,2h,TasteAtlas,"['First, add yeast and a teaspoon of sugar to lukewarm water, then whisk well to combine.

The traditional filling is typically only sugar syrup, butter, sugar, and cinnamon, but these days you will often find stroopwafels with a caramel filling. Historically, stroopwafels were about 10 cm (4""), but these days they range from 5 to 25 cm (2"" to 10"").

Danish Pastry Braid,"This crispy sweet is made with laminated dough, meaning the yeast-leavened dough is covered with butter and repeatedly folded over itself, which is a process fairly similar to one used to make puff pastry. Depending on the shape and ingredients, there exist various types of Danish pastry, such as frøsnapper, which is pastry twists sprinkled with sesame and poppy seeds, cinnamon rolls kanelsnegle, and poppy seed rolls tebirkes. There is also a chocolate bun chokoladebolle, a chocolate-glazed cinnamon roll direktørsnegl, and many more, as this is just the tip of an iceberg. However, the Danish pastry braid and spandauer, a round pastry filled with custard and jam, are the most popular varieties out of the entire Danish pastry family. All recipes start with making the dough, which is made with flour, butter, eggs, milk, sugar, yeast, and then left to rise up to an hour. It is then rolled out, and slices or shavings of cold butter are arranged on top of it. The dough is then folded over it, so the butter is completely covered. It is then rolled once again and folded in three layers, then refrigerated for 15-30 minutes. This step is repeated two more times, including the refrigeration, which results in a dough with a total of 27 layers, which a mark of true Danish pastry dough. The dough is then smeared with anything from remonce, a mixture of butter, sugar, and nuts or marzipan, to jam, custard, or cinnamon and then molded into the desired shape, either braids, rolls, twists, squares, rounds, to name a few. Before baking, the dough is glazed with an egg wash and can be sprinkled with sesame seeds, poppy seeds, or almond flakes.

Steamed Cha Siu Bao,"A Cantonese creation and the traditional part of a dim sum meal, cha siu bao is a pork roast bun that can be either steamed or baked, steamed cha siu buns being the better-known of the two. The two components needed to make the buns are the dough and the filling. The dough is characterized by its sweet and pillowy texture, which is due to the special method of preparation: it’s made days in advance with low-gluten flour and a starter, and the use of ammonium carbonate and baking powder causes the buns to split open during steaming. The filling is typically prepared with char siu pork, oyster sauce, soy sauce, chicken stock, scallions, ginger, and sugar for shine, then thickened with cornstarch. The key thing is to have the same amount of filling as dough and that the filling doesn’t pour out of the bun. Baked cha siu bao are prepared much the same way, except for the fact that they are completely sealed, as opposed to the steamed ones, and glazed before baking.

Cuban Sandwich,"Originally known as the mixto or mixed sandwich, the Cuban sandwich was introduced to Florida by cigar laborers arriving from Cuba at the beginning of the 20th century. The dish consists of lengthwise sliced Cuban bread, roasted pork, glazed ham, Swiss cheese, thin slices of dill pickles, and, according to some sources, mustard. When assembled, the sandwich needs to be pressed in la plancha, a sandwich press similar to a panini press, but without ridged surfaces. An important ingredient of the sandwich is the crusty Cuban bread, which is traditionally baked with palmetto leaves inserted along the top of the loaf, creating the recognizable split crust. Palmetto leaves allow the bread to expand during baking, the same as slashes do on other kinds of bread dough. The leaves do not influence the flavor of the bread; they are used simply for creating the signature crusty ridge. Key West and Tampa, the two big cigar factory areas which housed many foreign workers, including the Cubans, have different versions of the sandwich. In Tampa, besides the ingredients mentioned above, they also add Genoa salami, whereas, in Key West, the dish always includes lettuce and tomato.","Florida, United States Of America",4.4,"['3 cloves garlic', '1 tsp salt', '1 tbsp dried oregano', '1 cup (90g) minced onion', '1 cup (240 ml) sour orange juice', '½ cup (120 ml) Spanish olive oil', '1 (2 lbs/900g) boneless center-cut pork loin roast', '4 Cuban breads', 'butter, softened', 'dill pickles, sliced', '1 lb (450g) thinly sliced roasted Cuban pork', '1 lb (450g) thinly-sliced good quality ham', '½ lb (225g) thinly sliced mild Swiss cheese', 'yellow mustard (optional)', 'cooking spray']",4,30min,1h,3h 20min,4h 50min,TasteAtlas,"[""For the marinade, mash the garlic and salt in a pestle and mortar.

Depending on the type of onions and the amount of heat, this step can take as long as a few hours before the onions reach the right consistency and color. Liquid — usually water or beef broth — is added when the onions have been fully caramelized, and once everything is brought to a heavy boil, the heat is turned down, and the soup is left to simmer. The broth can be thickened with flour, either before or after adding the liquid. The finished soup is divided between individual crock pots, and dry bread or toasted croutons are placed on top.

Shanghai-Style Hong Shao Rou,"Hong Shao Rou, also known as red braised pork belly, is a traditional Chinese dish from the Hunan and Zhejiang provinces that holds a special place in Shanghai cuisine. The dish features pork belly braised in a mixture of soy sauce, caramelized sugar, and various spices, resulting in tender, flavorful meat with a glossy, caramelized coating. The Shanghai version consists of pork belly cut into thick pieces, caramelized sugar to achieve a signature red color and sweetness, and both light and dark soy sauces to add depth of flavor and color. The Hunan version, which is more traditional, will also include the Shaoxing wine, a Chinese cooking wine that enhances the overall flavor, and aromatics such as ginger, garlic, star anise, and cinnamon add complexity, dried chili peppers, bay leaves, and scallions. Unlike the Shanghai version, which is a mix of sweet and savory, the Hunan version is more spicy and aromatic. The cooking process begins with blanching the pork belly in boiling water to remove impurities. Sugar is then melted in oil to create a caramel base, and the pork is simmered in a mixture of soy sauce, wine, and spices for about an hour until it becomes tender and infused with flavor. The final step involves reducing the sauce to a thick, glossy coating on the pork. The slow braising process ensures that the pork belly achieves a melt-in-your-mouth texture. Often served with steamed rice or vegetables to balance its richness, Hong Shao Rou is a beloved comfort food in Chinese cuisine, appreciated for its deep flavors and satisfying texture.","Hunan, China",4.7,"['12 oz (360g) lean, skin-on pork belly', '2 tbsp oil', '1 tbsp rock sugar (rock sugar is preferred or you can use granulated sugar)', '3 tbsp Shaoxing wine', '1 tbsp soy sauce', '½ tbsp dark soy sauce', '2 cups (500 ml) water']",4,15min,1h,-,1h 15min,TasteAtlas,"['Begin by slicing your pork belly into 3/4-inch (2 cm) thick pieces.', 'Heat a pot of water until boiling, then add the pork belly pieces and cook for a couple of minutes.

Basic Nasi Goreng,"Enjoyed at home, from street food stalls or at fancy restaurants, nasi goreng is a versatile rice dish which can range from basic to extravagant. The preparation starts with leftover cooked rice, which is separated into individual grains to become fluffy and airy. Dried or fermented shrimp paste terasi is toasted briefly in a wok, and then ground into a seasoning paste with other ingredients such as shallots, garlic, and chili peppers, to name just a few. The seasoning paste is stir-fried briefly in a wok to release more flavor, after which the cooked rice is added. At this stage, ingredients such as seafood and/or finely chopped leftover meat may also be included. Finally, the nasi goreng is seasoned with kecap manis – sweet Indonesian soy sauce, which gives it a subtle sweet taste and a brownish color. Right before serving, nasi goreng is topped with a fried egg or an omelet, although an egg may also be whisked directly into the rice during frying. Nasi goreng is most commonly served with slices of fresh cucumber and tomato, prawn chips krupuk, a variety of pickles known as acar, and chili sauce sambal.

Paella Ribera Baxia,"Named after the pan in which it is made, Valencian paella is a dish traditionally cooked over an open fire of dried vines and orange-tree branches. Typical ingredients include meats like rabbit, snails, chicken, pork, and sometimes duck that are combined with several flat bean varieties like tavella and ferraúra, as well as garrofó, a dried white bean. Depending on the recipe, other possible ingredients include artichokes, various meatballs, and bell peppers, while saffron, which also gives paella its vibrant yellow color, is always the main aromatic in the dish. The preparation starts with either browning the meat or making sofrito from garlic, onions, paprika, and grated tomatoes. The vegetables are then stir fried until sauteed and stock and/or water is added next, followed by meat, rice, and saffron.

However, the amount of paprika added will vary from recipe to recipe, most of them calling for only two tablespoons, but some chefs claim that for a dish to have the most satisfying flavor, no less than a quarter of a cup is acceptable. Chicken meat which should preferably be skin-on, is added next. The pot is then covered, and the chicken is simmered over low heat until cooked, at which point sour cream is carefully stirred in.

Jamaican Jerk,"The term Jamaican jerk refers both to the preparation method and to the dry rub or wet marinade that is applied to the meat prepared in this way.

Sticky Toffee Pudding,"Chopped dates which have been previously softened in boiling water are folded into a mixture of creamed butter and sugar, eggs, flour, baking soda, and vanilla extract. The batter is then transferred to a cake pan and usually baked about 30 minutes or until the center is dry. For the sauce, brown sugar and double cream are added to the melted butter. The sauce is simmered for a few minutes until it turns golden brown and is then poured over the previously cut up squares of warm pudding. The last step is to place the pudding shortly under a broiler which should give it a bit of a crunchy top and make the sauce bubbly.

Classic Crêpes Suzette From Larousse Gastronomique,"A true example of how the simplest dishes can become attractive if the presentation is done right, crêpes Suzette continues to amaze every time they get served. This French dessert is basically sweet pancakes drizzled with a sauce called beurre Suzette, made out of caramelized sugar and butter, orange or tangerine juice, and zest. The final touch is a sprinkle of liqueur — preferably Grand Marnier or Orange Curaçao — which is set on fire or flambéd in front of the guest right before serving. Since alcohol evaporates when ignited, the process leaves a thick, caramelized, mouth-watering sauce.

Authentic Douarnenez Kouign-Amann,"Described as the ""fattiest pastry in all of Europe"" by the New York Times in 2011, a bready version of canelés, and a caramelized croissant, kouign-amann is a rustic round pastry from Brittany, precisely the town Douarnenez. According to the traditional recipe, it consists of three components in varying amounts: 40% bread dough, 30% butter, and 30% sugar. The bread dough is just flour, yeast, salt, and water, while the butter has to be salted, and generally speaking, all the ingredients must be of top-notch quality. Kouign-amann is prepared by the process of lamination, in which the butter and the sugar are folded into the dough to create super flaky layers. It is traditionally a round pastry, the size of an average American pie, and it’s characterized by a soft center and crunchy outside, full of aromas of browned butter and caramelized sugar.

Delmonico Steak,"Today, the general agreement is that a Delmonico steak is a thick, about 1 ½ inch (3.5 cm), boneless rib-eye steak, although other cuts are also used, such as the New York strip, bone-in top loin steak, or sirloin.

Classic Kapustnica,"Kapustnica is a traditional Slovak soup that is rich and hearty, and although it is an everyday meal, it is traditionally associated with Christmas. Sauerkraut, smoked meats, sausages, and mushrooms form the backbone of this dish, while other ingredients vary depending on region and from family to family. The preparation of kapustnica typically starts by sautéing onions, garlic, and spices in fat (often pork lard); sometimes flour is added as well to help thicken the soup. The sauerkraut is then added, along with the smoked meats, sausages, and rehydrated mushrooms. The soup is simmered for an extended period, allowing all the flavors to meld.

Germknödel,"Germknödel is a delightful Viennese yeast dough dumpling filled with spiced powidl (a special kind of plum jam) which is doused with melted butter and dusted with a mixture of ground poppy seeds and powdered sugar. Sweet yeast dumplings are a specialty of Austrian and Bavarian cuisine and are commonly enjoyed during the winter season. Although a sweet dish, germknödel is classified as an entree and not as a dessert due to its hefty and substantial nature. The hallmark of a traditional germknödel is powidl, a natural plum jam flavored with cloves and cinnamon, which, unlike regular plum jam or marmalade, does not contain sugar and gelling agents. Often, powidl is mixed with a small amount of rum to counteract the plums’ natural sweetness. There are two standard methods of preparing yeast dumplings — boiling them in salted water over medium heat or steaming them. Serving yeast dumplings with vanilla sauce instead of melted butter has become a popular variant of the traditional recipe. However, in South Bohemia, yeast dough dumplings can be seen filled with fermented blueberries and topped with curd cheese, and they are called kynuté borůvkové knedlíky (lit. fermented blueberry dumplings).","Austria, Europe",4.5,"['2 cups (250 g) wheat flour (type 405)', '1 tbsp (14 g) fresh yeast', '2 tsp (10 g) sugar', '4.2 fl oz (125 mL) whole milk', '2 tbsp (25 g) butter', '2 egg yolks', 'a pinch of salt', '8.8 oz (250 g) powidl', '3.5 oz (100 g) gray poppy seeds', '1 cup (100 g) icing sugar', '3.5 oz (100 g) butter']",4,30min,15min,-,45min,TasteAtlas,"['Start by sifting the flour and mixing it with a pinch of salt.', 'Dissolve the yeast in a small bowl of lukewarm milk.

Burnt Basque Cheesecake,"Basque cheesecake is an unpretentious crustless cheese-based cake that enjoys immense international popularity. It was invented at La Viña, a small pintxo bar located in San Sebastián, where it is known simply as tarta de queso. The cake is made with only five ingredients: cream cheese, eggs, sugar, heavy cream, and a spoonful of flour. The ingredients are combined and mixed into a smooth batter, which is then poured into a pan. The key is to bake the cake at a slightly higher temperature. This quickly bakes the top and the sides, creating a dark, caramelized layer that provides flavor and structure while the center remains smooth, custardy, and creamy. The edges and the top are supposed to be dark and look almost burnt—hence the name—but this is what gives this now legendary cake its distinctive caramel-like flavor.","San Sebastián, Spain",4.3,"['1 kg (2 ¼ pounds) cream cheese, at room temperature', '7 medium-sized eggs, at room temperature', '400g (2 cups) sugar', '1 tbsp all-purpose flour', '500 ml (2 cups) heavy cream']",10,10min,40min,-,50min,TasteAtlas,"['Preheat the oven to 200ºC (400°F).', 'Grease a 10-inch (25 cm) springform pan and line it with parchment paper.

Topfenstrudel,"Topfenstrudel, or quarkstrudel, is a strudel filled with soft quark cheese, a mild, fresh, creamy cheese product made from cultured buttermilk, which is traditionally found in several Central European countries,including Germany, Austria, and Poland (where it is called twaróg). The topfenstrudel dough is made with wheat flour, warm water, and oil. It is kneaded until soft and supple, then left to rest. While the dough is resting, the filling is made by mixing quark cheese, eggs, sugar, grated lemon peel, raisins, and vanilla extract. The rested dough is gently stretched and pulled until it becomes as elastic and as translucent as possible. The filling is placed on the dough, which is then rolled using a kitchen towel. The strudel is brushed with melted butter and baked in the oven. Once baked and cooled, it is dusted with some confectioners’ sugar.

Nixtamalized Corn Tortillas,"A tortilla is a round and flatbread made without a leavening agent that was created in Mesoamerica and is traditionally prepared with nixtamalized corn. Grain corn is first cooked, then left to soak in limewater. Next, it is rinsed and rubbed to get rid of the bran, then drained and ground into a relatively dry dough, known as fresh masa. The masa is then divided into chunks, flattened using a tortilla press or a rolling pin, and cooked on a heated comal, a traditional smooth, flat griddle. The faster way of preparing tortillas is by using masa harina, a dehydrated, and powdered fresh masa. Another version of the tortilla is the flour tortilla, typically made with wheat flour, water, fat, and salt. Flour tortillas are shaped and cooked in the same way as corn tortillas. Generally speaking, the size of this flatbread ranges from 6 to 30 centimeters, depending on the area and the dish for which it is used. The traditional, corn kind, which can be made with white, yellow, or blue maize dough, is used in a number of Mexican dishes, from tacos and enchiladas to tostadas and tortilla soup. It is also served as a side dish to stews, soups, and grilled meats. Wheat flour tortillas are especially popular in the USA, where they are used for preparing dishes such as burritos and quesadillas.","Mexico, North America",4.4,"['200g (7 oz) dried white, yellow, or blue dent or field corn', '600 ml (2 1/2 cups) water, plus more as needed', '3g (1/2 tsp) pickling lime (or other food-grade slacked lime)', 'masa harina para tortillas, as needed']",20,1h,1h,-,2h,TasteAtlas,"['Add the corn and the water into a medium-sized pot, then search and discard any stones left hidden among the kernels.

Éclairs,"With its shiny glaze, crisp exterior, and lighter-than-air filling, the éclair symbolizes the ultimate sublimation of classic French baking principles, providing an incredible vessel for utilizing a myriad of different flavor combinations. Éclairs share the same dough, known as pâte à choux, with other traditional sweets like profiteroles, gougères, and croquembouche. It is a simple dough made of butter, sugar, eggs, and water. Butter and water are first boiled, and flour is then added. When the mixture has cooled slightly, eggs are added one at a time while mixing vigorously. Once the dough is formed, it is transferred to a piping bag and piped into oblong shapes on a baking tray. However, it is the filling and glaze that make the éclair so truly exceptional. They are traditionally filled with vanilla or chocolate pastry cream and glazed with chocolate ganache, but today pastry cream serves as a base for any flavor imaginable, from salted caramel, pistachio, bergamot, or coffee to green tea and rhubarb. Some chefs have even begun making various savory versions of the éclair with ham, smoked salmon, and foie gras.

Sangría,"According to European legislation, sangría, which should have anywhere from 4.5 to 12% alcohol per volume, is made with red wine, citrus fruits, the juice of such fruits, a sweetener, usually sugar, and carbonated water. However, depending on the additional ingredients, sangrías differ not only from region to region but from household to household. If white wine is used instead of the traditional red, we are talking of sangría blanca, while in Catalonia they use a type of sparkling wine called Cava. There is also a special kind of sangría from Asturias which is made with their local cider. Spices such as cinnamon and ginger may be included, but also various fruits like peaches, apples, strawberries, pineapple, mango, and even bananas. Carbonated water may be replaced with either orange, lemon, or lemon-lime soft drink, while honey or sugar syrup can be used instead of sugar. Brandy and other spirits and flavored liqueurs can also be added. The preparation starts with washing and dicing the fruits which are then mixed in a large pitcher with sugar. The wine is then poured in, and the pitcher is covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated for no more than 3 hours. Carbonated water is added just before serving, so the bubbles do not evaporate. Sangría is served over ice, which for easier handling is often divided between individual glasses, instead of added to the pitcher. This queen of holiday drinks is usually served in the summer, but you can also find it year-round in the eastern and southern parts of Spain.","Spain, Europe",4.8,"['1 bottle of red wine', '1 bottle of soda', '200g (7 oz) (1 cup) sugar', '1 orange', '1 lemon', 'ice']",4,5min,-,-,5min,TasteAtlas,"['Cut the lemon and orange in pieces, remove the seeds, and put them in a large pitcher.', 'Add the sugar and the wine.', 'Mix with a spoon, then cover tightly with a plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2-3 hours.', 'Once ready to serve, add the soda water, then divide the sangría and ice between four large glasses.']",https://www.tasteatlas.com/sangria/recipe,https://www.tasteatlas.com/images/recipes/df0a25e66e7c4d4696375512aef37694.jpg?mw=910

For serving, panna cotte are unmolded, each onto an individual plate, and can be garnished with some fresh fruit, fruit sauces, or caramel.

In the Balkans, moussaka is prepared in Albania, Bulgaria, Bosnia, Croatia, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Romania, Slovenia and Serbia: potatoes are used instead of eggplant, and minced lamb meat is replaced with ground beef or pork. Turkish musakka, on the other hand, is not layered, and the Egyptians prepare their version with beef and eggplant dipped in tomato sauce and fried.

Classic Kimbap,"Often nicknamed “Korean sushi”, kimbap is a dish consisting of rice filled with vegetables, meat and/or seafood, wrapped in seaweed, and cut into round, bite-sized slices. Although it resembles sushi in appearance, its preparation is quite different, the main difference being the fact that the ingredients are always cooked or fried. The preparation starts with cooking or steaming short-grain white rice, which is typically seasoned with salt and soy sauce, and sometimes with a combination of vinegar, sugar, and salt. The vegetables – usually carrot, cucumber, burdock roots, and pickled radish – are cut into thin sticks, and then stir-fried shortly on oil. Kimbap can be prepared with meat, which is most commonly stir-fried or grilled beef, or various seafood such as tuna, salmon, surimi sticks, fish cake, or squid. Other popular fillings include fried eggs and kimchi, but the dish itself can also be purely vegetarian or vegan. The rice and the fillings are arranged on top of a seaweed sheet and rolled with the help of a bamboo mat. The fillings are tucked inside of the rice and held together by a thin layer of seaweed. Kimbap can be served cold or at room temperature and is a popular snack, quick lunch, or a picnic dish throughout Korea.","South Korea, Asia",4.8,"['360g (2 cups) non-glutinous rice', '500g (2 1/2 cups) water', '3g (3/4 tsp) salt', '13 ml (1 tbsp) sesame oil', '50g (1/4 piece, 1.75 oz) carrot', '50g (1/4 piece, 1.75 oz) carrot', '80g (1/2 piece, 2.8 oz) cucumber', '50g (1/4 piece, 1.75 oz) carrot', '70g (2.45 oz) pickled radish', '100g (3.5 oz) burdock roots', '13 ml (1 tbsp) edible oil', '17 ml (1 tbsp) vinegar', '200 ml (3/4 cup + 4 tsp) water', '27 ml (1 1/2 tbsp) soy sauce', '15 ml (1 tbsp) water', '6g (1/2 tbsp) sugar', '5 ml (1 tsp) refined rice wine', '80g (2.8 oz) minced beef', '12 ml (2 tsp) soy sauce', '2g (1/2 tsp) sugar', '2.3g (1/2 tsp) chopped green onion', '1.4g (1/4 tsp) minced garlic', '2g (1 tsp) sesame salt', '2g (1/2 tsp) sesame oil', '0.1g (a pinch of) ground black pepper', '2 eggs', '1g (1/4 tsp) salt', '6g (4 sheets) dried laver', '26 ml (2 tbsp) edible oil']",4,35min,50min,50min,2h 15min,TasteAtlas,"['Start with washing the rice thoroughly, and soak it in water for 30 minutes.

Larousse Gastronomique'S Lobster Bisque,"This thick, creamy seafood soup is traditionally made with lobster, shrimp, crab, or crayfish.

The meat is then sautéed with herbs, onions, garlic, and occasionally other vegetables such as leek or carrot, after which the pan is deglazed with white wine, brandy, or sherry. The broth and meat are then mixed together and simmered, after which the soup is puréed and finished with double cream and lemon.

Original Carpaccio,"Primal and sophisticated at the same time, the traditional Italian appetizer or entrée carpaccio may not involve any cooking, but preparing it flawlessly still demands skill and expertise. Traditionally, carpaccio is made from beef sirloin, although the tenderloin can be used as well. A raw piece of meat is first cleaned of fat and gristle and refrigerated overnight — or put in a freezer for about half an hour — until it cools completely. Next, the meat is cut into paper-thin slices using either a sharp knife or an electric meat slicer. Some recipes recommend pounding the meat slices to make them even thinner, but this is generally done with cuts of meat that are not as tender as sirloin or tenderloin. Additionally, some chefs tend to sear the meat on high heat, but since the essence of the carpaccio is preparing it with raw meat, this could hardly be described as a common technique. Thin slices of raw meat are then arranged on a cool plate in a single layer, seasoned with salt and pepper, and served immediately. The authentic recipe includes drizzling the carpaccio with the namesake sauce, which is a combination of mayonnaise, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, milk, salt, and pepper. On the other hand, carpaccio can also be served with a few drops of lemon juice and olive oil, sprinkled with parmesan cheese shavings, come capers and olives, a few arugula leaves, or even truffles. Alternatively, carpaccio can be prepared with raw fish such as tuna, salmon, or swordfish, or become a vegetarian dish based on zucchini or beet, to name only a few possibilities. Paired with a slice of fresh bread and a glass of chilled wine, carpaccio truly is a staple dish of 20th-century Italian cuisine.","Venice, Italy",4.9,"['1 kg (2.2 lbs) of young beef sirloin (about 600g/21 oz after cleaning)', 'salt', '250g (8.8 oz) homemade mayonnaise', '1 tsp freshly squeezed lemon juice', '1-2 tsp Worcestershire sauce', '30-45 ml (2-3 tbsp) milk', 'freshly ground pepper', 'salt']",6,15min,-,3h,3h 15min,TasteAtlas,"['First, take a piece of young beef sirloin and remove every trace of fat, gristle, and silver.

Traditional British Apple Crumble,"Quintessentially British, the crumble is a magnificent culinary display of accessibility, balanced flavors, and rustic and crispy textures. Atop of that, crumble is one the most versatile dishes one could come by. While both sweet and savory versions received international acclaim, at its root, crumble is a fruit-based dessert topped with a breadcrumb-like topping made with flour, butter, and sugar. Quick preparation time coupled with the accessibility of the ingredients makes the crumble one of the go-to desserts in British households and beyond. A classic British crumble employs medium-to-soft apples like Bramleys, which are coated with sugar and cinnamon and then baked with a crumbly topping. Traditionally, apple crumble is served with warm custard on the side. Other fruits commonly seen in a crumble are blackberries, blueberries, apricots, peaches, plums, and cherries. Modern adaptations of the classic recipe often add oats and various ground nuts to the topping to make it more coarse and crunchy. Apart from the custard, vanilla ice cream and whipped cream are also served with sweet crumbles nowadays. As far as savory crumbles go, most common fillings include minced meat and roasted vegetables enriched with various sauces. The topping largely remains the same with the exception of cheese being used instead of sugar, to give more depth and saltiness to the top crust.","United Kingdom, Europe",4.6,"['1 lb (450g) apples (Bramleys or other medium-to-soft apples)', '1 pinch of cinnamon, optional', '2 tbsp golden caster sugar', '6 oz (170g) all-purpose flour (or plain flour)', '4 oz (110g) golden caster sugar', '4 oz (110 g) butter (cold)', '1 cup (240 ml) custard (or to taste)', '1 pint (400 g) vanilla ice cream, optional']",4,10min,30min,5min,45min,TasteAtlas,"['Preheat the oven to 375°F/190°C.', 'Peel and core the apples, then chop them into chunky pieces.

Poutine,"The ultimate late-night snack, poutine, a dish of French fries, cheese curds and brown gravy, belongs to Québécois casse-croûtes (lit.greasy spoon) cuisine. When making poutine, preparing the gravy is the first step as it needs the longest to cook. Typically, you would start by making a beef broth packed with aromatics, although a roasted vegetable one is a good enough substitute. Once cooked, the broth is strained and thickened with a roux made with flour and butter. Next are French fries. Ideally, you would need a good russet potato, like Idaho or Yukon that you would slice into thicker fries, then preferably fry them twice, once at a lower temperature to cook them through and a second time at a higher temperature, so they become crispy on the outside. The squeaky cheese curds are usually purchased, but they can be made at home. When assembling poutine, crispy French fries are topped with cheese curds, and everything is poured over with warmed gravy, so the cheese melts into the fries.","Quebec, Canada",3.8,"['6 large russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch (1/2-cm) thick sticks', 'canola oil', 'salt', '1 ½ lbs cheese curds', '1 tbsp (15 ml) cornstarch', '1 tbsp (15 ml) water', '3 tbsp (45 ml) unsalted butter', '1/2 cup (30 ml) unbleached all-purpose flour', '1 clove of garlic, finely chopped', '1 can (10 oz) beef broth, undiluted', '1/2 can (10 oz) chicken broth, undiluted', 'pepper']",4,40min,25min,-,1h 5min,TasteAtlas,"['Place a large bowl of potatoes that you’ve submerged in cold water in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to 24 hours.

Authentic Ciabatta,"Light, crusty on the outside, and porous on the inside, ciabatta is an omnipresent Italian bread whose oval, slightly elongated form resembles a slipper. Its preparation takes quite a lot of time and skill, but the result is worth the effort. The first step is to prepare the biga or poolish, a starter dough made from beer yeast, some lukewarm water, and white wheat flour. The original recipe calls for special Uno Natura flour, but recipes for homemade ciabatta suggest using the mixture of Manitoba flour and Italian type 00 flour, which are responsible for a dough with extra elasticity. The starter dough needs to ferment between 12 and 24 hours at a controlled temperature, after which the remaining flour, sugar, salt, and water are added. The dough is folded gently and left to rise repeatedly during the process, as this way it becomes laced with bubbles which are the main characteristic of ciabatta. Ciabatta does not require additional grease or eggs, but water can be partially substituted with milk, which leads to a variation called ciabatta al latte. Optionally, other spices and fillings — such as olives, walnuts, capers, herbs, and bacon — can be added. Due to high water percentage, around 70%, the dough for a ciabatta is stickier and wetter that other bread doughs, which is why the most common mistake is adding extra flour. After the dough is finished, it is divided into separate ciabattas and left to rise one last time, and then baked in a very hot, steamed oven. The steam is released halfway through baking, which helps to form a crispy crust. A finished ciabatta can range in weight from 120 to 300 grams, and is perfect for sandwiches, and can be served with Italian cheeses, olives and meat products.","Adria, Italy",4.5,"['10 kg (22 lbs) Uno Natura flour', '5 L (5.3 qts) water', '25g (1 oz) beer yeast', '100g (3.5 oz) sugar', '2 L (2.1 qts) water', '250g (8.8 oz) salt']",50,24h,35min,-,24h 35min,TasteAtlas,"['Start by preparing the starter dough by mixing flour, water, and yeast with an electric mixer set at lowest speed for 5 minutes.', 'Cover with plastic foil and leave to rise at room temperature (23 to 25°C/73 to 77°F) for 16 to 22 hours.', 'Add sugar and salt, and gradually pour the water into the starter dough.

Cheesesteak,"A hoagie roll filled with ribbons of rib-eye, slices of provolone cheese, and sautéed onions, that in short, is the famed Philly cheesesteak. The meat of choice is rib-eye, very thinly sliced, but sirloin and round are also often used. When it comes to bread rolls, Amoroso brand is the way to go, although any crispy on the outside, soft but not chewy on the inside roll will do. Traditionally, a cheesesteak is made with provolone cheese although nowadays the use of the cheese spread Cheez Whiz is also considered authentic. The preparation starts with first freezing the meat, for easier slicing after. Once out of the freezer, the meat is thinly sliced, against the grain, and fried on a griddle while being pulled and chopped with spatulas. The onion is diced and fried separately, but can, depending on the recipe, be added to the meat, once it's near the end of frying, so the flavors meld together. At this point, the meat is usually seasoned with salt, and blanketed with slices of cheese which will melt from the heat of the grill. To assemble, the onions are a first placed on an open, warmed hoagie roll, followed by meat and cheese. The roll is then closed, cut in half and served. Although not traditional, cheesesteak can have additional toppings like pepperoncini rings or hot cherry bomb peppers, sautéed mushrooms, ketchup, and hot sauce.","Philadelphia, United States Of America",4.6,"['2 8 oz ribeye steaks', '4 soft white rolls', '8 slices cheese (provolone or white American), or, if you must, 1 jar Cheez Whiz (warmed)', 'seasonings (salt, pepper, garlic powder)', '1 onion', 'vegetable oil', 'optional sautéed/griddled toppings: green pepper (the traditional color, though red or yellow can be used for added sweetness), mushrooms', 'optional condiments: ketchup, mayo']",4,30min,20min,-,50min,TasteAtlas,"['Stick the steaks into a freezer for 45-60 minutes.', 'Slice the meat with a sharp knife or a meat slicer, if you own one, very thinly, against the grain.', 'Sauté the diced onion in vegetable oil until softened and slightly browned.', ""Heat the vegetable oil in a cast iron pan, if you don't have a flat top stove, then add the meat in small batches and season it pepper and garlic powder."", 'Season the meat with salt, then blanket the meat with two slices of cheese, and wait until the cheese melts.', 'Fill a sliced, warmed bread roll with the meat and the cheese, and a quarter of the onions, then close, cut in half, and serve.', 'Repeat same to get the remaining three cheesesteaks.']",https://www.tasteatlas.com/cheesesteak/recipe,https://www.tasteatlas.com/images/recipes/226b3ece8778474e8598bd50cb666fdb.jpg?mw=910

Larousse Gastronomique'S Steak Tartare,"Steak tartare is a traditional French appetizer, typically made with ground beef or horse meat. Although its history is jam-packed with various myths and legends regarding the dish’s origins, steak tartare has its roots in the early 20th-century delicacy called steak à l'Americaine. A classic steak tartare is prepared by finely mincing a piece of lean beef, seasoning it with salt, pepper, and Worcestershire sauce, then shaping it into a patty. As a final touch, a raw egg yolk is placed on top of the patty. Steak tartare is typically served with chopped onions, fresh parsley, and caper berries. Although considered revolting by some, steak tartare is by no means the only raw meat appetizer served in restaurants and households worldwide. In fact, many cultures have adapted the steak tartare recipe and made it their own. Rabiff (Swedish steak tartare), gyuniku sashimi (Japanese steak tartare), befsztul tartarski (Polish steak tartare) are just some of the examples of how wide-spread and appealing steak tartare has become. Depending on the culture-specific twist on the original recipe, steak tartare can be served with pickles, chopped chives, horseradish, Dijon mustard, the list goes on.

Kasutera,"This Japanese sponge cake is made with just flour, eggs, sugar, and a sugary syrup, such as honey, which also flavors the sponge. Today, castella can have a myriad of different flavors, such as matcha, chocolate, and brown sugar, but in Taiwan and some other South Asian countries like Singapore, a cheese castella cake is very popular. To prepare, eggs are first whisked with sugar to a ribbon stage, and the honey is stirred in next, followed by flour which is gently folded in. The prepared batter is poured into, traditionally, a wooden frame, and baked up to 50 minutes. If baked to perfection, kasutera should be moist, light, and with a very fine texture. There are two main preparation methods, the traditional one where eggs are beaten in a double boiler and the one where eggs are not beaten in a double boiler. There is also a third, less common, method where yolks and egg whites are first whisked separately and then combined. Most recipes today also include additional ingredients such as milk or water, and even mirin and rice wine. Popular variations of this cake, baby and suzu castella, are small, either round or bell-shaped and are sold at festivals from yatai food stalls.

The more famous of the group is sfogliatella ricca which is made with puff pastry, while the less known is sfogliatella frolla which is made with shortcrust pastry. And while making the puff pastry version is very time-consuming and requires a lot of work, the shortcrust pastry sfogliatella is much simpler.

Homemade Speculaas,"Fragrant, spicy, and delicate, speculaas cookies are a specialty most commonly associated with winter, most notably St. Nicholas Day and Christmas.

Some see them as a relative of gingerbread, although the speculaas cookies are lighter and use a broader array of spices. The preparation of speculaas is quite simple; however, it does call for time and patience. In the first step, the dry ingredients — flour, brown sugar, baking powder, and spices (which include cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, white pepper, ginger, cardamom, and anise), are mixed with butter, egg, and water or milk to get a firm dough. The dough is then left to rest in a refrigerator overnight, after which it is rolled to be approximately 3 mm (1/8-inch) thick.

Garlic is minced and softened in an oiled pan. Next, chili peppers are chopped and added to the garlic. Canned peeled tomatoes are blended or chopped, then mixed with the garlic and peppers. Pasta cooked al dente is fused with the ingredients in the pan, then finished off with a sprinkling of parsley and sometimes, pecorino cheese.

Classic Hungarian Krémes,"A thick layer of smooth, wobbly vanilla custard sandwiched between two layers of puff or flaky pastry dusted with powdered sugar — that, in short, is the description of krémes, a favorite Hungarian dessert. Thin sheets of flaky pastry or puff pastry dough are baked in the oven until lightly golden, and the custard is made by cooking egg yolks, sugar, vanilla, milk, flour, and sometimes gelatin over low heat.

Kolache With Cheese And Plum Jam Filling,"These pastries are made with sweetened, yeast-leavened dough that is shaped into rounds. An indentation in each piece of dough is made with the help of a glass, the bottom of which is pressed into the dough, thus creating room to hold the filling.

Traditionally, the pastries are filled with ingredients like poppy seeds, cottage cheese, raisins, and plum jam, but in modern iterations of kolache recipes fruits such as blueberries, apricots, cherries, lemon, and pineapples are also used.

Additionally, chefs will often pipe the third circle of paste on top of the bottom two to make it higher. However, if Paris-Brest is prepared as multiple individually-sized cakes, these will only have one ring of choux paste.

Traditional Ossobuco Alla Milanese,"Ossobuco alla Milanese is prepared by wine-braising veal shanks, and then slow- cooking them in beef broth until the meat becomes tender enough to cut with a fork.

Traditionally served with risotto, polenta, mashed potato, or spinach, ossobuco alla Milanese is a delicious and satisfying meal whose relatively low cost and ease of preparation has made it extremely popular both in Italy and abroad. The recipe starts off with a simple soffritto of chopped onion sautéed in butter or oil until translucent. Then, in the same pan, the lightly floured shank cuts are browned on both sides, braised in white wine, and slow-cooked in a covered pan over low heat.

Traditional Vanillekipferl,"These simple, crescent-shaped cookies are a staple not only in Austria but in other central European countries as well. The basic dough is made with only flour, sugar, ground walnuts, and butter, although an egg or an egg yolk might be added as well to make the dough more compact.

The preparation starts with making the dough which is shaped into a large roll and wrapped in cling film, and then refrigerated for a minimum of 30 minutes, a crucial step which will make the dough more manageable. Once the dough has had enough time in the fridge, it is divided into smaller portions and shaped into crescents.

Catania-Style Caponata,"With over 30 different recipes throughout Italy, this famous Sicilian vegetable relish can be easily tailored to match anyone’s taste. Traditionally, caponata is an eggplant-based dish prepared with the addition of tomatoes, peppers, capers, olives, onions, and celery. However, some recipes also call for the addition of pine nuts, almonds, raisins, or even artichokes or wild asparagus. After being sautéed one at a time, the vegetables are typically seasoned with sugar and left to simmer in vinegar, slowly melting into a tangy medley of sweet and sour flavors. Caponata can be enjoyed hot, although it is most often preserved for a few days after preparation and served as an antipasto course, either at room temperature or cold, which allows the flavors time to mellow and meld. Also, in some parts of Sicily, caponata is prepared with the addition of bitter dark chocolate — a common flavor enhancer left behind by the Spaniards that is present today in a number of traditional Sicilian recipes. To make caponata into an even more substantial dish, some recipes like caponata alla Catanese add potatoes to the mix, while the recipe for caponata Agrigentina features honey, lemon juice, and even seasonal fruit such as peaches or pears.","Sicily, Italy",4.6,"['800g (28 oz) eggplant, disgorged and diced beforehand', '400g (14 oz) green peppers, diced', '250g (8.8 oz) onion, julienned', '150g (5.3 oz) celery', '75g (2.5 oz) tomato concentrate', '100g (3.5 oz) green stoned olives', '25g (1 oz) capers', '40g (1.5 oz) pine nuts', '50g (1.8 oz) raisins', '100 ml (1/3 cup + 1 tbsp + 2 tsp) white wine vinegar', '100g (3.5 oz) sugar', 'extra-virgin olive oil, as needed', 'vegetable stock', 'salt, to taste', 'ground black pepper, to taste', 'basil leaves, to taste']",4,50min,30min,-,1h 20min,TasteAtlas,"['For the sweet and sour sauce, brown the julienned onions, add sugar and salt.

Costoletta Alla Milanese,"Cotoletta alla Milanese, or Milanese veal cutlet, is a traditional Italian dish which originated in Lombardy, Northern Italy. The dish consists of a veal cutlet pounded thin, covered in breading and fried in butter. Veal Milanese is quite similar to the Austrian Wiener schnitzel, but they differ in some key points; first, the Milanese cutlet is dredged only in breadcrumbs, while its Viennese cousin gets covered in both breadcrumbs and flour; and second, cotoletta alla Milanese is fried in butter, whereas Wiener schnitzel is fried in lard. Also, a cotoletta alla Milanese differs from the costoletta alla Milanese, with the former being a flattened scallop, and the latter a bone-in rib chop. Even though the preparation processes do not differ, the bone-in version is a more authentic one. To prepare the dish, dip a pounded veal chop into a beaten egg, and then in breadcrumbs, and fry the veal chops in a lot of butter over moderately high heat. Although the dish is traditionally made with veal, other kinds of meat have become popular to use instead, like chicken or turkey. The poultry variations are especially popular in the USA and other English-speaking countries. Another variation of cotoletta alla Milanese is called orrechio d'elefante (it. the elephant ear). It is comprised of a thinner but a larger cut of boneless meat. Grated parmesan cheese is also sometimes added to the beaten egg or mixed with the breadcrumbs. Cotoletta alla Milanese, also known as fettina panata, is usually served with potatoes, mashed, fried or baked, or some vegetables. Lemon wedges are often served on the side too.","Milan, Italy",4.4,"['4 bone-in veal cutlets', '2 eggs', 'large ground breadcrumbs', '100 g butter', 'salt', '1 lemon']",4,15min,15min,-,30min,TasteAtlas,"['After removing the membranes of the cutlets, flatten them with a tenderizer.', 'Beat the eggs in a bowl and dip the cutlets in, one at a time.

Baci Di Dama Di Tortona,"Baci di dama (lady’s kisses) is a traditional Italian cookie originating from Tortona, Piedmont. The dessert consists of two pastry caps joined together with a chocolate ganache layer, making it both crisp and fudgy. The cookie caps look like lips with an intent to kiss, hence the name lady’s kisses. Initially, this meltingly tender nut cookie was made with hazelnut flour, but recent adaptations of the recipe base the cookie dough on almond flour instead. Although the traditional recipe calls for a dark chocolate ganache, countless variations include white chocolate and fruit-based ganaches. Some of the best-known baci di dama variations suggest adding honey, cocoa, and flavorings such as vanilla sugar and orange zest to the cookie dough to make the dessert more fragrant. The preparation process takes about an hour, while the baking is done in less than 15 minutes. However, pastry chefs recommend leaving the dough to rest and chill in the refrigerator for a couple of hours before rolling it to ensure the right cookie texture.

Arequipa-Style Rocoto Relleno,"The Arequipa-style rocoto relleno recipe starts with thoroughly preparing the rocoto peppers. After cutting off their tops, they're meticulously boiled in salted water not once but three times in order to tame their spiciness. The peppers are filled with sautéed and minced pork and beef and a medley of ingredients like ají panca peppers, peanuts, hard-boiled eggs, olives, and raisins. The filled peppers are topped off with cheese and cut-off tops and baked, then served with baked potatoes topped with cheese. The Cusco-style rocoto relleno recipe is a similar concept executed a bit differently. The peppers are cut lengthways, and their spiciness tamed with lime-infused water.

Traditional Imeruli Khachapuri,"A dish many would consider Gregoria's national dish, Imeruli khachapuri is a type of bread with a cheese filling. What sets apart the Imeruli khachapuri from others in the khachapuri group, is its round shape. Typically, the dough is made with flour, water, milk, salt, and a leavening agent, either yeast or baking soda, but eggs, yogurt, buttermilk, and vinegar are often included as well. The filling is comprised of typically two kinds of cheese, the Sulguni, and the Imeretian cheese, but if Georgian cheese is not available, a mixture of mozzarella and feta in equal amounts is often used instead. The preparation starts with making the dough. The ingredients for the dough are mixed, then kneaded, and the dough is left to rise twice, the first rise is longer than the second. The cheese is grated and mixed, and if the mixture is falling apart, a small amount of egg is added, so it becomes compact. The dough is then shaped by hand into a circle and the cheese into a ball which is placed in the center of the dough. The sides of the dough are folded over the cheese and then sealed at the top. The khachapuri is then first flattened by hand and then rolled to the desired size. It can be baked either in the oven or in a pan on the stove. Optionally, when done, it can be brushed with butter. Imeruli khachapuri is served hot, cut up in wedges.","Imereti, Georgia",3.8,"['200g (7 oz) all-purpose flour', '100g (3.5 oz) milk, lukewarm', 'approx. 50g (1.75 oz) water, depends on the flour', '4g (1 tsp) fresh yeast', '4g (1 tsp) salt', '8g (2 tsp) sunflower oil, for greasing', '300g (10.5 oz) Imeruli cheese', '100g (3.5 oz) sulguni', '1 egg, if needed']",2,25min,10min,8h,8h 35min,TasteAtlas,"['Make the dough from flour, milk, water, and yeast.

Ensaïmada De Mallorca,"Ensaïmada is a Mallorcan coil-shaped pastry served with hefty amounts of powdered sugar.

Queso Helado,"Despite its name, ""cheese ice cream,"" queso helado is a cheese-free concoction. The traditional recipe is a blend of creamy milk infused with cinnamon, cloves, and coconut, sweetened with sugar, and enriched with egg yolks for a custard-like base. Once set in the freezer, it's served in squares dusted with ground cinnamon, making it a refreshing end to any meal. However, in the traditional preparation, a wooden barrel was used to house ice, sourced exclusively from nearby glaciers. Atop this icy bed, a metal pan was set. The creamy queso helado mixture was then poured in, and the pan was continuously rotated above the ice whilst also mixing the mixture, mimicking an inverted bain-marie technique. This method allowed the mixture to swiftly freeze against the chilled metal surface, after which it was expertly scraped off with a spatula or metal spoon.","Arequipa, Peru",4.4,"['1 1/3 L (5 1/2 cups) fresh whole milk', '150g (8.8 oz) sugar', '150g (8.8 oz) freshly grated coconut', '2 cinnamon sticks', '4 cloves', '4 egg yolks, well-beaten', '1 tsp ground cinnamon']",6,15min,25min,1h,1h 40min,TasteAtlas,"['Simmer the milk with cinnamon, cloves, and coconut for ten minutes on low heat, stirring occasionally.', 'Strain the mixture, stir in the sugar, and boil for two more minutes.', 'Next, whisk in the well-beaten egg yolks quickly to avoid any strands forming.', 'Take it off the heat and allow it to cool down.', 'Pour the mixture into containers and freeze for several hours.', 'Before serving, take it out of the freezer for a few minutes, cut into squares, and garnish with a sprinkle of ground cinnamon.']",https://www.tasteatlas.com/queso-helado/recipe,-

Original Nachos,"A popular snack that is enjoyed at sporting events, in bars over a cold drink, and as an appetizer, nachos can be prepared simply, quickly, and with just a few basic ingredients. The first building block is tortillas, preferably corn flour ones since their taste is more intense. They are cut into quarters which will each become a single triangle-shaped nacho. Next, tortilla triangles are either brushed with some oil and baked in an oven or under a broiler or fried shortly in a skillet in hot oil. After being cooled slightly, they are topped with grated longhorn cheese and a slice of pickled jalapeño pepper and baked again shortly, so the cheese melts. Nachos are often served with various dips such as sour cream, salsa, guacamole, and ranch dressing. The authentic nachos recipe evolved over time, so nowadays nachos can be prepared with virtually any topping imaginable. Most common suggestions include beans, small pieces of meat, or minced meat such as chili con carne, chorizo, or bacon, onions, cilantro, corn, olives, tomatoes, and there are even sweet nacho varieties with fruit, chocolate, cinnamon, and ice cream.","Piedras Negras, Mexico",4.1,"['3 corn tortillas', '1 cup (3 oz) (90g) shredded longhorn cheese', '1 tbsp canola oil', '12 pickled jalapeño slices']",3,5min,13min,-,18min,TasteAtlas,"['Begin by preheating the oven to 350°F/180°C.', 'Apply oil to both sides on each tortilla using a brush.

Churros Madrileños,"The basic churro recipe is nothing more than flour, water, salt, and oil, while sugar is for dusting only. The preparation starts with making the dough. Flour is added to a pot of boiling water and mixed until the dough has formed. Once cooled, the dough is placed inside a special syringe called churrera that is fitted with a star-shaped nozzle. Next, the dough is pressed into the sizzling oil in either long, straight sticks, or into spirals or curls. While they are frying the churros will turn golden at which point they’re removed from the oil and placed on paper towels to drain. They are then cut up into smaller sticks, dusted with sugar, and served while still hot. These fried dough sticks are typically eaten for breakfast and are usually paired with either chocolate, dulce the leche, or coffee and milk, all three of which are intended for dunking, not drinking. Churros — sold predominantly in churrerías, specialized churros shops — are popular not only in Spain but across Latin America, as well as parts of United States. They can be plain, have various fillings, or be topped with different glazes. Depending on the region, these crispy treats will have a different preparation method and are known under various names. For example, porra is a bigger churro variety and is prepared with either yeast or baking powder, while tejeringos, which are native to Cádiz, Grenada, and Málaga are traditionally ring-shaped.","Spain, Europe",4.1,"['1 cup (120g) flour', '1 cup (240 ml) water', '1 tsp oil', 'a pinch of salt', 'olive oil', 'sugar']",6,15min,10min,2h,2h 25min,TasteAtlas,"['In a large saucepan boil water with salt and a tablespoon of oil, then immediately add the flour swiftly stirring until you have a smooth, thick mass.', 'Remove from heat, and allow to cool, then place inside a pastry bag fitted with a star-shaped nozzle.', 'Press the mass into the sizzling oil in the shape of a doughnut, and fry until golden.', 'Place on a paper towel to drain, sprinkle with sugar, and serve while still hot.']",https://www.tasteatlas.com/churros/recipe,https://www.tasteatlas.com/images/recipes/389840869dad4935bd6906f6f93cccd9.jpg?mw=910
Original Mama Ninfa’S Fajitas,"Like any other simple meat dish, fajitas rely heavily on the quality of its ingredients and skillful preparation. The main building block of this Tex-Mex classic is beef, specifically the tender and buttery skirt steak, which is marinated in a mixture of citrus and pineapple juice, soy sauce, chili powder, pepper, garlic, and aromatic spices, with an occasional addition of oil and brown sugar. The steak is then placed on a hot grill and cooked medium-rare to medium, so it remains juicy on the inside. After resting for 10 to 15 minutes, the meat is cut across the grain or diagonally into thin strips, and served with grilled, slightly charred strips of bell peppers and onion slices. A side of hot tortillas and condiments is brought to the table as well, and everyone assembles their own fajita.

Basic Vanilla Milkshake,"Most Americans connect the milkshake to childhood: a single sip takes them back to the times when every problem in the world could be solved with this sweet, cold, and tasty beverage. The milkshake is made with milk and ice cream with the addition of flavored syrups and any other ingredients that may come to your mind — whipped cream, melted chocolate, caramel, butterscotch, chocolate chips, coffee, liquors, spices, crushed nuts. The texture depends heavily on the preparation: milkshakes prepared by hand in a traditional steel shaker tend to have a bit denser texture than the ones from an electric blender or a milkshake machine. Other than in the USA, milkshakes are popular in most English-speaking countries, where they are sometimes referred to as thick milkshakes or thick shakes, and in New England and Canada, the term frappe is used to differentiate the ice-cream based milkshake from the one without ice cream.

Red Miso Soup,"Served either as a breakfast or an appetizer, miso soup or misoshiru reflects the elegance of Japanese cuisine in its purest form. The preparation starts with dashi, a simple broth made from dried or dried and smoked fish (sardines, kelp, and skipjack tuna) or mushrooms (shiitake). Next, some miso paste — red, white, mixed, or other variations — is dissolved in some dashi. The mixture is then added to the rest of the dashi and brought to a simmering point. The next step is to include solid ingredients such as tofu, vegetables, algae, meat, fish or clams, which are put into the simmering soup until they are cooked or warmed. The miso soup is always served hot, usually with a bowl of rice: the Japanese drink the soup first and then eat the solid ingredients with chopsticks.","Japan, Asia",4.5,"['3 1/3 cups (800 ml) dashi or sardine stock', '1/2 cups (55g) nameko mushrooms (or 2 shiitake mushrooms)', '1/3 cake tofu', '4 tbsp red miso', '4 stalks trefoil', 'ground sansho pepper']",4,2min,5min,-,7min,TasteAtlas,"['Prepare the stock to your liking.', 'Cut the mushrooms into thin slices.

Classic Grilled Cheese,"The basic recipe for this classic sandwich consists of nothing more than slices of American cheese tucked between two slices of buttered bread. The assembled sandwich is heated on both sides until the cheese melts and the bread becomes crispy and golden brown. Contemporary recipes will often substitute the tried and true American cheese with Swiss, cheddar, pepper jack, or provolone, and also add additional ingredients like avocados, tomatoes, onions, and peppers. There are several ways to prepare grilled cheese – the sandwich can be heated on a griddle, grilled, pan-fried, or toasted in a panini toaster. It is not uncommon for each part of the sandwich to be cooked separately and then assembled, or to coat the outsides of each slice of bread with grated cheese before cooking, a style known as the 'inside out' grilled cheese sandwich.

Traditional Spring Rolls,"Featured on each and every Chinese restaurant menu around the world, spring rolls are a versatile appetizer which should be brittle and crunchy on the outside, and tender and flavorful on the inside. They are a member of a large dim sum family, which includes small, bite-sized appetizers served in small baskets or plates, often with a dipping sauce. Generally, the filling for spring rolls is made with pork and/or seafood stir-fried with various vegetables, such as cabbage, carrots, mushrooms, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, and spring onions. Typically, the filling is marinated in or seasoned with soy sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, sesame oil, and rice wine. When it comes to wrappers, they can be made from rice or wheat flour and water, while egg may or may not be added to the dough. The filling is rolled inside a wrapper which is then sealed with a mixture of cornstarch and water, whisked egg or egg white.

Classic Pavlova,"Most commonly served in Australia and New Zealand as a part of Christmas dinner and for other festive occasions, pavlova — or the pav, as they tend to call it — requires simple yet fresh and quality ingredients and some skill for its preparation. The base of a pavlova is made with egg whites, caster sugar, cornflour, lemon juice, or other acids (such as vinegar or tartaric acid), and vanilla extract, which are mixed until peaks are formed. It is then baked at a low temperature to become crunchy on the outside and marshmallow-like on the inside and carefully cooled in a turned-off oven, with the door ajar. It is essential that the base of a pavlova does not get in touch with cool air at this point since that may cause it to drop. The dried and cooled base is covered with whipped cream and sliced fruit — the usual combination includes strawberries, bananas, kiwis, and passion fruit.","New Zealand, Australia And Oceania",4.5,"['6 egg whites', '10 tbsp sugar', '2 tsp vinegar', '1 tsp vanilla essence', 'whipped cream flavored with few drops of vanilla', 'fresh fruit (peaches, strawberries, lemon, passion fruit), finely chopped', '1 lb (450g) granulated sugar', '1 ½ cups (360 ml) of water', '1 oz (30g) powdered gelatine', '½ tsp tartaric acid', '2 egg whites', 'vanilla essence']",8,15min,45min,5h,6h,TasteAtlas,"['Beat the egg whites very stiff, then gently add sugar, vinegar, and vanilla essence.

English Breakfast,"English breakfast is a dish that consists of a number of components such as back bacon, eggs, British sausage, baked beans, fried tomato, fried mushrooms, black pudding, and fried and toasted bread; however, these can vary depending on where you are in Great Britain. The Scottish will add potato scones, haggis, and oatcakes, while the Welsh may include laver bread or cakes and perhaps Penclawdd cockle. Irish on the other hand will add in white pudding, Irish soda bread, and Irish potato cake. Traditionally, this dish also included things like bone marrow, pork crackling, and a huge pork chop, and baked beans were always homemade. Even though the eggs can be fried, scrambled or poached, the majority of the ingredients are fried; hence the dish is colloquially known as the fry-up.

Cordon Bleu,"Thinly pounded veal or pork cutlets are layered with a slice of Swiss cheese and a slice of ham, then either folded in half or rolled and breaded, and can be either deep fried or pan fried. Chicken Cordon Bleu is prepared in the same manner, except that the chicken breast must first be butterflied. Alternatively, this dish can also be made with ham in which case it's filled with cheese and mushrooms before it’s breaded and fried. For best results, a mild and hard melting cheese is preferred, while the choice of ham — deli, cured, prosciutto, or bacon ham — is entirely a matter of personal preference of the chef.

Besides turkey, which is the centerpiece of the Thanksgiving table, a variety of side dishes are prepared, and they usually differ depending on where in the United States you are. Mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and gravy are a must, while dishes like brussels sprouts, sweet potatoes with brown sugar, molasses, or marshmallows, corn and green beans, green bean casserole, creamed onions, glazed carrots, bread rolls, biscuits, cornbread, sauerkraut, collard greens, and even macaroni and cheese are also very common.

The assembled cake is heavily decorated with the remaining whipped cream and chocolate shavings and is topped with fresh or candied cherries. Traditionally, however, the Black Forest cake may also have a base made of shortcrust pastry that acts not only as a base but also as a contrasting texture to the softness of the entire cake. Buttercream can sometimes be used instead of whipped cream or combined with it, while the sponge cake, either Génoise or Viennese sponge cake, can be baked in three or four tins or just in one and then cut up in layers.

Authentic Spanish Meat Migas,"Most national cuisines around the world have at least one traditional dish based almost entirely on leftovers, and Spain and Portugal are no exceptions to this rule. Their specialty is called migas, which translates as breadcrumbs, and it can be served as an appetizer, side dish or an individual meal for lunch or breakfast. The key ingredient for this dish is old, dry bread which is combined with oil or lard, garlic, salt, and paprika. Migas can often be enhanced with fresh or leftover meat, sausages, bacon, ham, fish, vegetables, eggs, or anything else from the pantry – there are even sweet versions of migas which include fruit, nuts, cinnamon, and chocolate. When it comes to preparation, it is rather simple: the bread is cut into slices or small pieces, or crumbled by hand, and soaked in slightly salted water — either overnight or until it becomes moist. Next, some oil or lard is heated on a frying pan, followed by garlic and paprika which give migas its distinctive taste. If migas is prepared with meat, it is tossed into the same frying pan, followed by water-soaked bread. Alternatively, the meat can be heated or sautéed and served on the side. All the ingredients are stirred constantly until the water evaporates, and the breadcrumbs become golden and crispy. Finally, the migas is served hot, most commonly in the same pan it was prepared in, or on a large plate, garnished with orange slices, grapes or meat.","Spain, Europe",4.6,"['500 g leftover bread', '150 g meat remaining from of a stew', '4 cloves garlic', '4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil', 'water', 'salt', '1 tbsp paprika']",4,5min,15min,-,20min,TasteAtlas,"['To begin, cut the bread into slices, place them in a bowl and cover with water.

Classic Tahini Sauce,"The simplicity of preparation, widely available ingredients, plus virtually no fuss in the kitchen is what made tahini popular not just in Israel, but also worldwide. The word tahini — or tahina — may refer to two different things. The first one is a paste made with roasted sesame seeds, salt, and oil, which serves as a base for the namesake dip or sauce, in which tahini paste, garlic, water, and lemon juice are combined into a form of a purée. Tahini paste — also called raw tahini — is usually store-bought, but it can also be prepared at home in just a few minutes. Raw sesame seeds are roasted in an oven or on a skillet for 3 to 5 minutes until they start changing color, but they should not be allowed to become golden or brown. Next, they are ground into a paste with vegetable or olive oil, and a pinch of salt. The old-school way is to use a mortar and a pestle, but using a food processor will make the process quicker and easier. The main difference between the store-bought and the homemade tahini paste is that the store-bought kind is commonly made with hulled sesame seeds, which is why it tends to be smoother than the homemade one. To make tahini dip or sauce, garlic, water, and lemon juice are added to the tahini paste and mixed in a food processor until the desired consistency is reached. Amounts can be adjusted to taste, and tahini dip will keep well for 3 to 4 days if kept in an air-tight container in the refrigerator. Tahini sauce can be served as a spread on various types of flat bread or pita bread, used to prepare other spreads such as hummus or baba ghanoush, added in soups or utilized as a condiment for meat and fish dishes.","Syria, Asia",3.7,"['3/4 cup (200 g) raw tahini', '2 garlic cloves', '1/4 cup lemon juice (from 2 lemons)', '1/2 cup cold water']",4,10min,-,-,10min,TasteAtlas,"['Place the raw tahini, garlic, lemon juice and water in a bowl of a food processor.', 'Pulse until you have reached a smooth consistency.', 'Adjust the amount of water, garlic and lemon juice to reach the texture and flavor you prefer.']",https://www.tasteatlas.com/tahini/recipe,https://www.tasteatlas.com/images/recipes/ee1e3891b56c44d5b993da88fb7a3c65.jpg?mw=910

Simple Oyakodon,"Belonging to a group of donburi dishes — which are made up of cooked or steamed rice that is topped with a range of cooked or fresh ingredients — oyakodon, also known as oyako-donburi, consists of a mixture of chicken meat, eggs, and onions served atop a bowl of rice. The preparation starts with combining the ubiquitous fish stock dashi with soy sauce, sugar, rice wine mirin, and rice liquor sake in a pan, and bringing them to a boil. Then, small pieces of the chicken thigh are added and cooked through. Adding finely sliced onion is mandatory, but the oyakodon may be enriched with other ingredients such as shiitake mushrooms, edamame, green beans, and leek. Then, a whisked egg is poured over the top and left to cook for 1 to 3 minutes. Finally, the mixture is gently slid over a bowl of freshly cooked or steamed rice, garnished with some chopped green onion or nori algae, and served.

Bellini,"A common find on the brunch menus today, Bellini is a classic cocktail made with two parts Prosecco and one part fresh peach purée. To prepare, the peach purée is poured into a chilled champagne flute first, followed by Prosecco, and the cocktail is then stirred gently, so the bubbles do not break. The original Bellini also included a small amount of raspberry or cherry juice which gave it a lovely pink glow. Variations on the original include a Puccini which has fresh mandarin juice in place of peach purée, a Rossini which is made with fresh strawberry purée, and Tintoretto, a cocktail made with fresh pomegranate juice.

Traditional Quiche Lorraine,"It is not surprising that quiche became one of those iconic dishes prepared worldwide: it is simple, versatile, and easy to make, and can be served both as an appetizer, a side dish, or a light brunch or dinner. The first step in preparing quiche Lorraine is deciding which type of pastry to use — available options are either shortcrust or puff pastry. Most modern recipes suggest using pre-made pastry, but you can also do it yourself if you have time. The pastry is rolled evenly with a rolling pin and then placed in a round baking tin with ruffled edges: it needs to cover both the bottom and the sides of the rolling tin, rising slightly above its edges. The pastry is then pierced with a fork, after which it can be pre-baked or filled and baked all together. Keeping it simple is a general rule for making the filling for quiche Lorraine: cream and eggs are whisked together and seasoned with salt, pepper, and, optionally, nutmeg. Diced and fried bacon is also an important part of the filling: you can sprinkle it on the bottom of the pastry before pouring in the custard or simply mix it in the custard. Finally, quiche Lorraine is baked and served warm, sliced in triangles. A side of fresh salad and a glass of chilled wine will complete the picture.","Lorraine, France",4,"['200g (7 oz) flour', '100g (3.5 oz) butter', '1 pinch of salt', 'cold water, as needed', '4 eggs', '200 ml (3/4 cup + 4 tsp) crème fraîche', '200g (7 oz) smoked bacon', 'pepper, as desired', 'nutmeg, as desired (optional)']",8,1h,30min,30min,2h,TasteAtlas,"['Place flour and salt into a large bowl, add the cubes of butter, and work the butter into the flour with your fingers until the mixture becomes breadcrumb-like.', 'Knead, adding cold water tablespoon by tablespoon to the flour and butter mixture just until it comes together into a smooth dough.', 'Wrap the ball of dough in cling film and refrigerate for 30 minutes.', 'Set the oven to preheat to 200°C/400°F.', 'Lightly flour your working surface, then place the ball of dough on the flour and roll it out to fit a 23 cm (9-inch) quiche pan, making sure you roll it out enough to cover the bottom and the sides of the pan.', 'Place the dough into a quiche pan, taking care it covers the bottom and the sides.

Basic Chawanmushi,"This Japanese custard is made with eggs, dashi, soy sauce, and mirin, plus numerous other ingredients like chicken, white fish, shrimp, shiitake mushrooms, kamaboko, gingko nuts, lily roots, carrots, Japanese parsley mitsuba, and many others. However, if udon noodles are added, the dish is not called chawanmushi but odamakimushi. The preparation begins with making the custard. The eggs are first whisked, then seasoned (typically) with dashi, mirin, and soy sauce. Then, to ensure the silkiest texture possible, the eggs are strained through a fine mesh sieve into another bowl. The other ingredients such as mushrooms, meat, fish, and vegetables are divided between cups, and the custard is then poured over. The cups are then covered with a lid or aluminum foil and either steamed or cooked in a water bath on low temperature anywhere from 15-30 minutes, depending on what ingredients were used. Chawanmushi is cooked when the edges have set, but the center is still slightly loose. If done to perfection, chawanmushi should ooze a clear broth when poked with a skewer. Unlike other Japanese dishes, chawanmushi is eaten with a spoon and not chopsticks. It is served either as an appetizer or a side dish, usually as a part of a traditional Japanese dinner called kaiseki-ryōri.","Kyoto, Japan",4.9,"['1 (5-inch) piece kombu', '2 tbsp bonito flakes', '1 1⁄2 tsp mirin', '1 1⁄2 tsp soy sauce', '3 large eggs']",4,15min,30min,-,45min,TasteAtlas,"['First, set the oven to preheat to 325°F.', 'To make dashi, boil kombu with 1 ½ cups of water, then take off the stove, take out the kombu, and add bonito flakes.

For example, tostadas de tinga are topped with tinga, a dish of shredded meat (usually beef or chicken, but also pork), tomatoes, chile chipotle, onions, and garlic that is typically used as a garnish or as a filling. Tostadas de frijoles, on the other hand, are spread with refried beans and then topped with various ingredients. Tostada de pata de res which has a cow's feet topping is also well-known.

Spoonfuls of the batter, about ¼ cup, are then dropped onto a hot and greased skillet and fried until the surface becomes interspersed with bubbles, at which point the pancake should be flipped and fried for no more than a minute or two.

New York-Style Pizza,"Unlike Chicago-style deep-dish pizza, the essence of the New York-style pizza lies in its thin crust, which is elastic enough to be easily bent but firm enough to keep all the ingredients in place when eaten in slices. The process starts with preparing the dough, which can take up to 24 hours and relies on the feeling and experience rather than strict measures. Flour, sugar, salt, and yeast are combined with olive and water by hand or in a food processor until the dough is smooth and elastic. Since renowned New York pizza places prepare their dough in special dough-making machines, it is advised to use a food processor for home preparation to prevent the dough from over-oxidizing. The dough needs to rest in the refrigerator after the first kneading, and the general advice is to let it sit for at least 24 hours and up to 5 days before preparing the pizza itself. One hour before baking, the dough should be left to rise at room temperature and then stretched using the knuckles of your hand to form a circle 12 to 14 inches (30 cm to 35 cm) in diameter and 1/4-inch (0.6 cm) thick. The outer rim should stay slightly thicker than the center. Aromatic tomato sauce is spread evenly on the surface, followed by full-fat, grated, dry mozzarella cheese. The pizza is then baked for 12 to 15 minutes at a 500°F/260°C temperature or for mere 3 to 5 minutes in original pizza places that use old-school coal ovens. The pizza is done when the rim and the bottom are slightly browned, and the cheese has melted completely.

Classic Île Flottante,"Unlike most classic French desserts, île flottante or floating island is surprisingly simple to make and requires only basic culinary skills and ingredients. Its preparation can be divided into four steps: making the meringue, preparing the vanilla custard cream or crème Anglaise, cooking the caramel, and assembling. The meringue is prepared by mixing the egg whites, sugar, and a pinch of salt into a firm snow, and baking it shortly in the oven in a bain-marie. To make the vanilla custard, the milk with a scraped vanilla pod or some vanilla extract is slowly brought to a boil, while the egg yolks are beaten with sugar to become fluffy and pale yellow. The mixture of egg yolk and sugar is poured into the vanilla-flavored milk and cooked over low heat until it thickens. In a separate saucepan, sugar and water are boiled together until a caramel syrup is formed. Finally, there are two ways to serve and assemble the floating island. One way is to pour the vanilla custard into a large bowl, place the entire amount of the meringue on top in one piece, and drizzle it with caramel syrup. The bowl is brought to the table with a large ladle so that each person can adjust the meringue to custard ratio to their liking. Alternatively, the floating island can be served in individual ramekins — a ladle of custard is topped with a dollop of meringue and decorated with caramel. Some recipes, on the other hand, suggest coating the ramekins with caramel before pouring in the custard. Floating island can be served cold, making it a worthy substitute to ice-cream on a hot summer day, or at room temperature. Light, fluffy, and slightly old-fashioned, this recipe is a great solution for the ones in search of a fail-proof dessert.","France, Europe",5,"['800 ml milk', '1 vanilla bean', '8 egg yolks', '8 egg whites', '1 pinch salt', '290 g caster sugar (divided: 40 g + 250 g)', '100 g caster sugar', '2 tbsp water']",8,25min,30min,-,55min,TasteAtlas,"['Split the vanilla bean and scrape it into the milk.

The Royal Society Of Chemistry Yorkshire Pudding,"Yorkshire pudding is a traditional English dish made with a simple batter of eggs, flour, milk, or water, and a pinch of salt. In order for the Yorkshire pudding to rise well during baking, the batter must be very light, fluffy, and airy, and the fat on the bottom of the baking tin must be extremely hot. According to the English Royal Society of Chemistry, a Yorkshire pudding isn’t a Yorkshire pudding if it is less than four inches tall. It is baked either in portions using separate smaller tins or in a large, shallow roasting tin, after which it is cut into squares for serving. The texture depends on the type of liquid used; a Yorkshire pudding made with more water will be crispier, whereas one made with extra milk will be richer and of a softer texture.","Yorkshire, England",4.3,"['4 1/2 tbsp of plain flour', '3 eggs', 'half milk, half water to make a thin batter', '1/4 tsp of salt', 'Beef dripping, as needed']",6,25min,15min,10min,50min,TasteAtlas,"['Set the oven to preheat to maximum temperature.

Pastiera,"This traditional Neapolitan delicacy is traditionally prepared for Easter, on Holy Thursday or Good Friday. However, it is prepared year-round nowadays and can be sampled in the city’s pasticcerias, shops selling pastries and cakes. Pastiera is a tart with a shortcrust pastry shell filled with a mixture of ricotta, sugar, grano cotto (cooked wheat), eggs, yolks, and candied fruits, flavored with orange blossom water and vanilla. Cinnamon is also common, but there are debates about whether or not it should be included, with purists claiming that a true pastiera does not contain cinnamon. Strips of shortcrust pastry dough are arranged on top of the pie, either in the shape of a Greek or a St. Andrew’s cross. Usually, seven strips are arranged on top of the pie, four strips are arranged first, and then three are placed on top of the first four. The finished pastriera should be left to rest for two days, so the flavors can develop, which is the reason it’s traditionally prepared two to three days before Easter.

Chicken Chimichanga,"Crispy on the outside and richly filled on the inside, chimichanga is a specialty of the American South-Western cuisine, particularly the state of Arizona where it was invented. It is similar to a burrito, but the main difference is that it is deep fried. Usually, it is filled with meat — beef, chicken or pork — which can be combined with rice, beans, chili or jalapeño peppers, onions, garlic, and sauces. Shredded cheese can be used as a filling, but it is more common to serve it on the side. The tortillas are filled and folded into a tight cylinder, and then deep-fried in oil.

Italian Academy Of Cuisine'S Saltimbocca Alla Romana,"Pan-fried veal cutlets wrapped in Italian prosciutto, flavored with fresh sage, and sautéed in white wine — it doesn't get more straightforward than that. The recipe itself doesn't require many ingredients, but if you want your saltiambocca to taste like the one from a Roman restaurant kitchen, the ingredients must be of top quality. To prepare the perfect saltimbocca alla Romana, your veal cutlets must be pounded very thin, making the meat extra tender. The prosciutto should be sliced paper-thin and used with the fat on, as this will lend even more flavor as the fat renders out during frying. Lastly, for sautéing, use a skillet or a pan that is large enough to hold all of the cutlets comfortably, and bear in mind that they hardly need more than a few minutes per side.","Rome, Italy",4.7,"['8 veal scallops', '4 slices of prosciutto', '8 sage leaves', '50g (3 tbsp + 1 tsp) butter', '2 tbsp dry white wine', 'salt and pepper, to taste']",8,10min,5min,-,15min,TasteAtlas,"['Start by gently flattening veal scallops with a meat mallet until very thin.

Traditional Chana Masala,"Although the list of ingredients for chana masala might seem exotic for someone outside India, this versatile dish is actually an everyday thing, and can be served as breakfast, main meal, light dinner or street food. Its texture can also vary — it can resemble soup, be as dense as a stew, or reduced to almost completely dry. Chana masala may be a vegetarian dish, but since it is legume-based, it is a rich source of protein. The main ingredient is the chickpeas, known as chana or chole in India, and two varieties are most commonly used: white, slightly bigger chickpeas, or the dark, smaller variety. Dried chickpeas are soaked in water overnight and cooked in a pressure cooker or in a regular pot, which lasts longer. They are often replaced with canned chickpeas: they do not need to be cooked, just washed out and set aside. Onion, garlic, and ginger — the latter two crushed into a paste — are sautéed in oil, after which a blend of spices is added. The regular list includes coriander, cumin, turmeric, chili and garam masala, a popular spice blend used for preparing numerous Indian dishes. A sliced green chili pepper is added to give extra spiciness to this dish, and its amounts can be adjusted according to taste. Next, comes the tomato purée made either from fresh or canned tomato, followed by pre-cooked chickpeas. The chana masala is then simmered for roughly 30 minutes, and water can be added to adjust the density of the dish. Garnished with some fresh coriander leaves, and served with rice or one of the many varieties of Indian flatbread like naan, roti, parantha and poori, chana masala is enjoyed hot and with a side of lassi – sweet or savory yogurt-based drink.","Gujarat, India",4.7,"['4 tbsp sunflower oil', '2 onions, chopped', '1 inch ginger, grated', '5 cloves garlic, grated', '3 cup tomatoes, chopped', '2 ½ tbsp coriander powder', '1 tsp powdered turmeric', '2 ½ tbsp cumin powder', '1 tsp powdered red chili', '2 ½ cups chickpeas, soaked overnight', '2 ½ cups water', '2 pinches powdered salt', '4 green chilies, sliced', '1 tsp garam masala powder', '1 handful coriander leaves, chopped']",4,15min,45min,-,1h,TasteAtlas,"['To begin, take a large pan and heat the oil over medium flame.

Classic Biltong,"Similar to beef jerky in the USA, biltong is, without a doubt, the most popular meat snack in South Africa. Although its preparation method might seem simple or even primitive at first sight, it is actually a mélange of culinary knowledge and ingredients gathered across three continents — Africa, Europe, and Asia. The first step is to prepare the meat. Unlike the modern versions, which are most commonly based on quality cuts of beef, such as silverside or topside, the classic approach calls for game meat, while extravagant versions include ostrich or crocodile meat. The meat is cut into thin and long strips along the grain and seasoned with salt. After one hour, the salt is scraped off, and the meat is brushed with, or dipped into, vinegar whose purpose is to kill the potentially life-threatening bacteria. Sometimes, Worcestershire sauce and sugar are combined with the vinegar to achieve a richer flavor. Next, the meat is rubbed with a combination of spices — coriander and pepper are mandatory, while additional options include cloves, garlic, paprika, chili flakes, or a specialized store-bought blend simply called biltong spice. Hanging the meat and drying it is the next and final step — it can be done in a well-ventilated room, in an oven at low temperature, in a specialized homemade biltong box heated by a light bulb, or in more sophisticated biltong drying machines. The length of drying can vary from 3 to up to 7 days, depending on the desired texture — dry, moist, or in-between. After drying, biltong is kept in a refrigerator, or in a vacuum-sealed plastic wrap. As for serving, biltong is typically cut in thin slices or diced and offered as a snack, but it can become an ingredient of almost any dish, ranging from spreads, pâtés, salads, soups, and stews, to quiches and even pizza.","South Africa, Africa",4.1,"['beef (preferably silverside)', 'rock salt', 'coarse ground black pepper', 'coarse ground coriander', 'vinegar']",0,45min,-,1h,4d 1h,TasteAtlas,"['First, prepare the beef: cut 1/2-inch (1.25 cm) thick strips along the grain, and make each strip is around 6 inches (15.25 cm) long.', 'Season the meat with salt on each side.

Ricotta Crostata,"At it’s most basic, crostata consists of a filling — either fruits, custard, jam, or ricotta — enclosed in an Italian version of shortcrust pastry called pasta frolla. However, unlike the French tart and the American pie, the dough for the Italian crostata is made by kneading soft butter into the flour which gives it a cake-like texture. Crostata is usually round, either open-faced or with a woven lattice top, but can also be made as a free-form pie.

Traditional Coq Au Vin,"Combining a rich dark sauce with flavorful onions, lardons, mushrooms, and tender browned pieces of rooster meat, coq au vin is a great make-ahead meal perfect for entertaining, as it can be simply reheated before serving. This crowd-pleaser also lends itself easily to large parties, as the recipe can be easily doubled or tripled. Coq au vin is even better the day after it is made, as all the ingredients will have had time to steep overnight. According to the traditional recipe, coq au vin is prepared using rooster meat which is gamey and tough when compared to younger chicken meat predominantly sold in stores today. The sauce is made with a whole bottle of red Burgundy wine, which is thickened with rooster's blood near the end of cooking. Mushrooms and onions are typically cooked separately and added either near the end of cooking or once the dish is cooked to avoid overcooking. Regional variations differ in the type of wine used. Even though both dishes often include morels and cream, coq au vin jaune from the Jura region is made with vin jaune, a type of white wine, while Riesling wine is the wine of choice for the Alsatian coq au Riesling. Coq au pourpre or coq au violet is made with Beaujolais nouveau wine which is produced from Gamay grapes, and there is even coq au Champagne from the namesake Champagne region.

Basic Bublanina,"Fresh, juicy summer fruits and berries enveloped in a soft sponge cake — that, in short, is bublanina, a typical Czech dessert which can also be found in Slovakia. This simple dessert is prepared by mixing wheat flour, sugar, eggs, butter or oil, and baking powder into a batter, which can also contain vanilla sugar or vanilla extract, lemon zest, and milk. The batter preparation method varies greatly from one recipe to another. For instance, all the ingredients can simply be mixed in one bowl; the more advanced recipes suggest mixing the dry ingredients first, and then adding the wet ones; while some call for whipping the egg whites into a firm snow, which is then folded into the batter to make it fluffier. The batter is poured into a greased baking pan dusted with flour, and the fruit — fresh, frozen, or canned — is arranged on top. Although some believe it is best to enjoy bublanina during summer, when there is an abundance of fresh, ripe fruit, frozen or canned varieties are a great substitute. Cherries, sour cherries, strawberries, raspberries, plums, peaches, apricots, and forest fruit can be used separately or mixed depending on personal taste.

Classic Penne Alla Vodka,"This Italian-American or American-Italian dish is quite simple to make, and it includes easily available ingredients. The preparation starts with sautéing onions and garlic in heated olive oil. Next step is to add crushed tomatoes and vodka, which are supposed to simmer until reduced by half. The heavy cream is then stirred in, which will give the sauce a bright orange color. The combination of tomatoes and cream is rarely seen in Italian cooking, because the acidity of the tomatoes may cause the oil from the cream to separate. Vodka – or its Italian relative, grappa – serves as an emulsifier which will keep the ingredients homogeneous. Meanwhile, the pasta – preferably penne, tubular-shaped pasta - is cooked in boiling salted water until they are al dente. Grated cheese such as parmesan can be mixed into the sauce or sprinkled on the finished dish.

Le Petit Larousse'S Classic Crème Caramel,"Just like its kindred dish, crème brûlée, crème caramel is a showcase for the elegance of classic French cooking. Also known as flan or caramel pudding, this dessert is made of custard with a layer of soft, liquid caramel on top, while crème brûlée has a crispy caramel topping that needs to be broken down with a spoon. The preparation process starts by boiling whole milk with a scraped vanilla pod and sometimes even sugar. After the milk has cooled, the vanilla pod is removed, and the milk is boiled once again to lock the flavor. In the next stage, the custard is made by mixing sugar with whole eggs and egg yolks and pouring in the vanilla-flavored milk. The custard is then strained and set aside, and in the meantime, caramel is prepared by melting sugar in some water until it reaches 180°C/350°F and a golden-brown hue. A thin layer of hot caramel is poured in ramekins — small, single-portioned ones are most common — which are then filled with custard. Alternatively, one large ramekin can be used, but this is usually avoided due to the fact that the custard is quite sensitive and may fall apart during serving. Finally, the ramekins are placed in a bain-marie, or a water bath, and baked in an oven for three hours at a low temperature (around 150°C/300°F). The assembled dessert is cooled to room temperature and then refrigerated. Right before serving, the ramekins are turned upside down — hence the French term crème renversée — and the crème caramel is gently released, so the liquid caramel is on top. Variations are mainly based on enriching the custard with different ingredients, such are orange or lemon zest, rose water, lavender, spices (e.g., cinnamon), or even pieces of fruit.","France, Europe",5,"['1 L (4 cups + 3 tbsp) whole milk', '3 vanilla pods', '4 whole eggs', '3 egg yolks', '350g (1 ¾ cups) sugar (200g/1 cup for custard and 150g/3/4 cup for caramel)', '60 ml (1/4 cup) water']",4,25min,3h,24h,1d 3h,TasteAtlas,"['Split and scrape the vanilla pods, place them in milk and bring to boil.

Bobotie,"This South African casserole is made with either beef or lamb and is typically seasoned only with turmeric and curry; however, various recipes call for an array of spices, such as allspice, nutmeg, and cloves. Milk-soaked bread is added principally to provide moisture, although nowadays, pork is often added to the meat mixture for extra moisture and flavor. The recipe gets its sweetness from dried fruits and nuts, such as raisins, sultanas, almonds, and walnuts, as well as apples and dried apricots. Onions are first sautéed and then added to the remaining ingredients and baked. Some chefs choose to also sauté the meat together with the onions — in this case, the final baking time is shorter. Near the end of baking, the bobotie is coated with an egg and milk custard and decorated with either bay leaves, lemon leaves, or orange leaves, and occasionally also banana slices, almond slivers, and coconut shavings. Once baked, bobotie is usually served with a side of yellow rice, chutney, and sambal — a salad made by combining either cucumbers, onions, tomatoes, carrots, or apples that is typically chili-based.","South Africa, Africa",4.1,"['1 slice homemade-type white bread, 1 inch thick, broken into small bite-sized pieces', '1 cup (240 ml) milk', '2 tbsp butter', '2 lbs (1 kg) coarsely ground lean lamb', '1 ½ cups (180g) finely chopped onions', '2 tbsp curry powder, preferably Madras type', '1 tbsp light-brown sugar', '1 tsp salt', '½ tsp freshly ground black pepper', '¼ cup (60 ml) strained fresh lemon juice', '3 eggs', '1 medium-sized tart cooking apple, peeled, cored and finely grated', '½ cup (80g) seedless raisins', '¼ cup (30g) blanched almonds, coarsely chopped', '4 small fresh lemon or orange leaves, or substitute 4 small bay leaves']",6,35min,40min,10min,1h 25min,TasteAtlas,"['First, set the oven to preheat to 300°F/150°C.

Mrs. Goodfellow'S Lemon Meringue Pie,"Lemon meringue pie is one of the few desserts that have received international acclaim. The pie is composed of a shortcrust pastry base, a tangy lemon curd, and a fluffy meringue. It all starts with making and pre-baking the pie crust. Flour, salt, butter, and water are combined into a dough ball that is then flattened, covered with plastic wrap, and left in the refrigerator to rest. The dough is then rolled out into a circle, placed within a pie mold, lined with a piece of parchment paper topped with baking stones, and baked until golden brown. For the lemon filling, eggs, sugar, egg yolks, lemon juice, and lemon zest are whisked together and simmered over medium heat. Once thickened, cubed butter is stirred into the mixture until it melts completely. The lemon curd is then evenly distributed across the shortcrust pastry and left to cool in the refrigerator. Lastly, for the meringue, egg whites are mixed at medium speed until foamy. One tablespoon at a time, sugar is added to the egg whites, which are then whipped until stiff peaks start to form.

Semla With Crunchy Almond Filling,"Mainly associated with Fat Tuesday, since in the past, it was the only day of the year when one could eat it, semla is the traditional Swedish dessert that has become so beloved, nowadays it's eaten from Christmastime all the way through Lent. The main components are a cardamom-spiced wheat bun, an almond filling, whipped cream, and powdered sugar. The dough for the buns is a yeasted, butter-rich dough that is shaped into buns, which can be glazed with an egg wash before baking, but that is not a must. The top of the bun is cut off, the crumbs are scooped out the bottom part of the bun, and the hollowed-out insides are filled with an almond filling. Swirls of whipped cream are piped on top and then covered with the cut-off bun top, which acts as a lid. Before serving, the dessert is dusted with powdered sugar. Still, serving semla in a bowl of warm milk is the traditional way of serving this dessert, in which case it's called hetvägg. Also, apart from Sweden, different versions of semla are eaten in different countries of Scandinavia. However, the difference is mainly in the filling. Raspberry or strawberry jam is often used instead of the almond filling, but the filling can be just whipped cream or pastry cream. Plus, in Denmark and Iceland, for example, buns are made with puff pastry.","Sweden, Europe",4.8,"['50g (1.75 oz) fresh yeast', '240 ml (1 cup) whole milk, room temperature', '100g (1/2 cup) sugar', '350g (3 cups) all-purpose flour', '240 ml (1 cup) whole milk, room temperature', '150g (3/4 cup) sugar', '200g (3/4 cup + 2 tbsp) butter, cubed', '10g (2 tsp) salt', '750g (1 2/3 lbs) all-purpose flour', '1 egg', '1 tbsp freshly ground cardamom', '100g (3.5 oz) sweet almonds', '100g (1/2 cup) sugar', '200g (7 oz) almond paste', '100g (3.5 oz) toasted almonds with peel, coarsely chopped', '50g (1/4 cup) sugar', '10g (2 tsp) vanilla powder', '1-2 grated bitter almonds or 1 tsp bitter almond oil', '50-100 ml (1/4 cup - 1/2 cup) whole milk (start with the smaller amount and add more if you need)', 'whipped cream', 'powdered sugar, for dusting']",16,1h 30min,35min,2h,6h 35min,TasteAtlas,"['To make the starter, first, dissolve the yeast in warmed milk.

Authentic Pandoro,"Pandoro, or pan d’oro (lit. golden bread), is a classic Veronese sweet bread served in Italian households during the Christmas season. However, pandoro should not be mistaken with panettone, a similar sweet bread containing raisins and various candied citrus fruit. Pandoro is a beautifully elegant dessert made with wheat flour, mother yeast, sugar, category A fresh chicken eggs, butter, salt, and vanilla. Apart from its silky smooth texture and golden crust, what makes pandoro stand out is its eight-pointed star shape. When dusted with icing sugar, one could easily see the resemblance between pandoro and the Italian Alps’ snowy peaks. Although the ingredients necessary to make pandoro are basic, the process is relatively time-consuming and arduous. A traditionally made pandoro will have had three proofing stages, which means it takes more than thirty hours to make. First, a starter dough is made by repeatedly refreshing the mother yeast with flour and water, leaving the yeast to rise after each new addition. The starter dough is then combined with water, sugar, butter, egg yolks, and flour, creating the first dough that is left to rise for 12-16 hours. Once the first dough has had time to proof, the second dough is made following the same procedure. This time, powdered milk, white chocolate, and aromatic emulsion (made by combining butter, orange zest, honey, and vanilla) are added to the dough. After the second dough has had 40 minutes of proofing, it is twisted and left to rise for 30 more minutes. The twisting is repeated once again, and then the dough is transferred into a traditional, high-sided pandoro mold, where it is left to rise for 4-6 hours at room temperature. The sweet bread is then baked for 40-50 minutes until its inner temperature reaches 204°F/96°C. Once cooled, the pandoro is dusted with powdered sugar. Recent adaptations include filling the pandoro with custard, cream, liquor or serving it with melted chocolate. To pandoro is often sliced horizontally to achieve a more festive look, with the resulting slices assembled in a shape resembling a Christmas tree.","Verona, Italy",4.5,"['3.5 oz (100g) mother yeast/lievito madre', '450g (1 lb) flour', '275 ml (9.3 oz) water', '4.4 oz (125g) of mother yeast', '2 cups (245g) of flour for pandoro/panettone type 00 or strong flour (manitoba) with at least W380 / 14% - 15% protein', '3 oz (90 ml) of water', '6 ½ tbsp (80g) granulated sugar', '3 oz (85g) cold egg yolks', '½ cup (117g) Ocelli or high-quality butter, room temperature', 'a pinch of salt', '1 cup (120g) flour for Pandoro / Panettone type 00 or strong flour (Manitoba) with at least W380 / 14% - 15% protein', '1 tsp (3g) malt', '1.3 oz (40 ml) water', '2 tbsp (30g) granulated sugar', '4.1 oz (90g) cold egg yolks', '½ cup (117g) high-quality butter at room temperature', '0.25 oz (7.5g) excellent quality white chocolate', '2 tsp (10g) powdered milk (skim or whole)', '1 tbsp (15g) aromatic emulsion', 'a pinch of salt', '2 tsp (10g) high-quality butter', '2 tsp (10g) honey', 'seeds of 1 Bourbon vanilla bean', 'grated orange zest']",8,1h,2h,2d 10h,2d 13h,TasteAtlas,"['The evening before you start preparing the pandoro, after having refreshed the mother yeast for a whole week, mix 3.5 oz (100g) of mother yeast, 7 oz (200g) of flour, and 3.4 oz (100 ml) of water together.

Auguste Escoffier'S Classic Sauce Velouté,"A true classic of French cuisine, sauce velouté is a velvety concoction of veal, chicken, or fish stock and roux — melted butter thickened with flour. Although it may seem simple at first glance, its preparation is quite time-consuming, and, when done right, employs a number of culinary techniques. The preparation starts with making the stock. Fresh bones are broken into pieces and simmered in water. Although roasting the bones is more than welcomed in the preparation of some stocks and soups, in this case, it should be avoided. During the lengthy cooking process, which can take up to 5 hours, the fat and the impurities must be skimmed off the surface regularly, in order for the stock reach its clear texture. Meat, carrots, onions, leeks, and herbs are added in the next step, and the stock is simmered for an additional 3 hours. It is then strained and set aside to cool slightly while moving on to the following chapter — the roux. Butter and flour are combined in a saucepan over low to medium heat, and their function is to thicken the sauce. The next step is quite delicate: the stock is poured into the roux, and to avoid lumps the mixture needs to be stirred constantly. At this point, the velouté can be seasoned with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. A small portion of mushroom skins and trimmings may also be added to enrich the taste. The sauce is simmered gently for 1,5 hours after which if it is strained, and cooked for an additional 30 minutes. Once again, the velouté is strained through a muslin cloth, so it becomes smooth and velvety, and is cooled by being stirred gently. At this moment the sauce can be served with meat, chicken, or fish, or used as a base for other sauces, such as sauce Suprême, Allemande, Bercy, and others. Sauce velouté is sometimes confused with béchamel because they both have white roux as a building block. However, the main difference is that velouté uses stock, while béchamel uses milk, and that velouté is slightly darker than the béchamel.","France, Europe",4.3,"['10 lbs veal shin', '7 qt cold water', '15 oz carrots', '7,5 oz onions, stuck with a clove', '5 oz leeks, strung with a stick of celery', '1 bunch fresh herbs (1,25 oz parsley, 1 bay leaf, 1 spring thyme)', '8 oz clarified butter', '9 oz flour', '1 lb pale roux', '5 qt white veal stock', '1 oz salt', '1 pinch nutmeg', 'white pepper, to taste', '1/4 lb white mushrooms’ skins and trimmings (optional)']",16,48min,2h 10min,-,2h 58min,TasteAtlas,"['Start by preparing the white veal stock.

Qatayef I,"One of the most recognizable Ramadan sweets, qatyef is a stuffed pancake that is either fried or baked, but can also be left uncooked after it’s been stuffed. However, unlike regular pancakes, Arabic pancake qatyef is only baked on one side, which leaves the other side bubbly and soft, perfect for soaking up the delicious filling. The traditional fillings include sweetened clotted cream eshta, nuts like pistachio, hazelnuts, or pine nuts, while savory qatayef is usually filled with cheese, or left plain and served with soups. The basic batter for the pancakes is made with only flour, yeast, baking powder, salt, and water, but older recipes will also include semolina flour. Milk, whole wheat flour, sugar, oil, and various flavorings such as orange blossom water or rosewater are also common in recipes. Once filled, then baked or fried, qatayef is either dipped in or drizzled with syrup. Depending on their size, qatayef can be classified into three categories — regular, mini, and giant. The mini qatayf or qatayef asafiri is filled with clotted cream eshta and then dipped into ground pistachios, but unlike regular qatayef, it is not baked nor fried.

Classic Gallo Pinto,"As a dish invented to salvage the leftovers from the day before — namely, black beans and rice — gallo pinto barely needs a recipe, if you ask the Costa Ricans. If you decide to make it from scratch, note that the first step is soaking the dried beans overnight: this will soften their skin and shorten the cooking time. The beans are then cooked on medium heat for about three hours or until tender, and a small amount of water they were cooked in needs to be set aside. Next step is to fry the rice in some vegetable oil, and sauté it with some finely chopped onions and bell peppers: some recipes even suggest adding minced ham or sausage to this mixture. The rice and vegetables are then cooked in chicken broth or water until they become tender. Finally, some of the water the beans were cooked in is added to give the dish its specific color, and all the ingredients are sautéed once again. If pre-cooked beans and rice are used, it is enough to sauté them with vegetables in some vegetable oil. Gallo pinto is most commonly served for breakfast — the Costa Ricans pair it with coffee — but is also a common sight during lunch or dinner. The dish is so popular that it can be found virtually everywhere — from upscale hotels to fast-food chains such as Burger King. Local variants either omit the peppers (in Guanacaste province) or add some shredded coconut (on the Caribbean side of Costa Rica). One last thing that should be mentioned is Salsa Lizano, a store-bought sour-sweet condiment, which is served with almost every meal in Costa Rica, and gallo pinto is no exception.","Costa Rica, Central America",4.9,"['1 lb (450 g) black beans (fresh or dried)', '8-10 sprigs cilantro (fresh or frozen, not dried)', '1 small or medium onion', '1/2 small red or yellow sweet pepper (optional)', '3 cups (700 ml) chicken broth or water', '2 cups (350 ml) white rice', '1/2 tsp salt', '1 tbsp vegetable oil (for frying the rice)', '1-3 tbsp oil (for frying the gallo pinto)']",4,10min,3h 50min,-,4h,TasteAtlas,"['If you use dried beans for this recipe, soak them in water overnight.

Traditional Hasselbackspotatis,"Hasselbackspotatis – known as hasselback potatoes outside their country of origin – are a famous Swedish interpretation of roasted potatoes. The main feature that makes Hasselbackspotatis stand out — both visually and in terms of texture — is their unique way of preparation: the potatoes are cut into thin slices almost all the way through. This leaves the slices anchored at the bottom of the potato while they sprawl at the top, resembling the shape of an open accordion. The roasted potatoes' layered appearance brings a dose of exclusivity and new aspects to the texture of a usually predictable ingredient: the deep cuts result in a crispy crust on the outside, contrasted by the soft, tender insides of the potato. Traditionally, Hasselbackspotatis are salted, coated with butter, and covered with breadcrumbs. However, their unique shape and formula lend themselves well to endless variations and decorations. Some variations include stuffing the separations between slices with bacon, salami, or varieties of cheese, adding various garnishes (pepper, rosemary, thyme, parsley, garlic, grated parmesan), as well as a variety of sauces. In its traditional form, hasselbackspotatis is a fulfilling side dish to beef steaks and other hearty meals. Still, some of its more substantially enriched variations can be served as the main course, ideally accompanied by various salads.","Stockholm, Sweden",4.1,"['1 kg (2.2 lbs) potatoes', '50g (1.75 oz) butter', '15g (1 tbsp) flake salt', '15g (1 tbsp) breadcrumbs']",4,15min,45min,-,1h,TasteAtlas,"['Preheat the oven to 225°C (around 435°F).', 'Melt the butter in a saucepan until it turns golden.', 'Peel the potatoes, and then cut them into thin slices.

Doughnuts,"According to The Oxford Companion to Food, a doughnut is a ""deep-fried ball or ring of soft dough"". The dough is typically yeast-risen and is made with flour, butter, eggs, sugar, milk, and salt, often flavored with vanilla. Alternatively, there is also a cake dough version which is leavened instead with baking powder. Most typically, the dough is shaped into rings by either cutting it out of the dough with a doughnut or a cookie cutter or by gluing the ends of a long and thin rolled piece of dough, which is the less often used method of the two.

Fish And Chips,"The national dish of Great Britain, fish and chips is one of the country's favorite takeaway meals, and it's incredibly easy to prepare at home. The traditional recipe calls for fillets of cod or haddock that are first evenly coated in a batter made of just flour, water, and baking soda and then fried in beef dripping or lard, while potatoes, which are cut somewhat thicker than regular French fries, are double fried to make them crispier. For serving, fish and chips are just sprinkled with salt and vinegar and are typically plated with a side of mushy peas. Variations on the recipe include using sparkling water or beer instead of tap water, adding milk or eggs to the batter or frying the fish and potatoes in vegetable oil instead of lard.

Larousse Gastronomique'S Macarons Ordinaire,"One of the world's best-known confections, macarons are notoriously difficult to make. While most recipes follow the same procedure as outlined here, slight variations do exist, most of which involve the way the meringue is prepared. Macarons made with French meringue have a crispier shell and an airier texture, while those made with Italian meringue have a soft shell and chewy interior. Almond flour is combined in a mixture with icing sugar, which then is carefully folded into the meringue. The resulting batter is spooned into a piping bag and piped into rounds onto a baking tray, taking care to make sure each round has enough space to expand during baking. Once the baking tray has been filled, it is lightly tapped to ensure any unwanted air is released from the macarons, after which they are left to rest and form a skin. Macarons are baked quite briefly, for about 15 minutes, and left to completely cool. They are then assembled by sandwiching the desired filling — typically buttercream, ganache, or jam — between two macaron rounds, and should then be chilled for 12 to 24 hours for the flavors and textures to gel. Various flavor and color combinations of both macaron rounds and fillings exist today, from more traditional ones like chocolate, raspberry, and vanilla, to more daring ones like matcha and foie gras.","Paris, France",4.3,"['200g (7 oz) almonds, blanched', '300g (10.5 oz) sugar', '2 egg whites, plus 1/2 egg white, optional', ""confectioners' sugar, as needed""]",3,30min,20min,30min,1h 20min,TasteAtlas,"['First, set the oven to preheat to 180°C/350°F, grind the blanched almonds until they turn almost powderlike (once ground, sift them to remove any lumps), and line two baking trays with parchment paper.', 'In a large bowl, combine together the sugar and the almonds, then fold in the two egg whites.', 'Using a mixer, whisk the mixture until it turns smooth.

Pretzels,"A pretzel is a baked snack prepared with a dough usually comprised of flour, yeast, sugar, butter, and water that is twisted into a specific pretzel knot. The preparation starts by gathering all the ingredients for the dough, then mixing and kneading them until a smooth dough is obtained, which is then divided into chunks that are rolled out and shaped into pretzels. Formed pastries are often dipped in lye (laugenbrezeln) or a baking soda bath, then sprinkled with some salt, and baked in the oven until brown. Besides salt, they can be topped with sugar, chocolate, cheese, cinnamon, nuts, and seeds. Numerous versions of the dish co-exist throughout Germany. In the region of Franconia, this pastry is often purchased sliced crosswise and coated in butter, or topped with some cheese or lunch meats. Swabian pretzels are thinner at the ends and have a high content of fat, while the Bavarian kind remains evenly thick throughout and incorporates a small amount of fat. In some parts of the country, sweetish New Year's pretzels are exchanged on January the 1st. Some other modifications of the dish include unglazed, pudding, and anise-flavored versions. The traditional, soft kind should be eaten in the hours following the preparation, while hard-baked ones, an American invention, will stay fresh longer.

Traditional Apple Pie,"Even though every American probably has their favorite way to make apple pie, the traditional apple pie is a double-crust pie, with a filling of thin slices of apples, sugar, a small amount of flour, bits of butter, and spices such as cinnamon in the middle. Alternatively, the filling can be precooked to prevent a soggy crust and to intensify the flavors and can include additional spices such as allspice, nutmeg, and lemon juice. Also, some recipes call for tapioca or cornstarch instead of flour to thicken the filling. If the pie does not have a decorative latticework top, is essential to make vents in the top crust so that steam can escape during baking.

American Pancakes,"A stack of fluffy pancakes drizzled with butter and maple syrup is a favorite way to start a day for many Americans, especially on weekends when one has more free time on its hands. Typically, the ingredients needed are just flour, eggs, milk, baking soda, and butter, while some chefs also like to add sugar and vanilla, or exchange milk for buttermilk. The preparation, which takes no more than a few minutes, is incredibly simple, as you just add wet ingredients to dry ones and whisk until you have a thick batter. Portions of the batter are dropped onto a greased and heated skillet into disks that are 4-inches (10 cm) wide. Once bubbles appear on the surface of the pancake, it is carefully flipped and cooked for another minute or two, then transferred onto a plate. The basic recipe can be enriched by incorporating additional ingredients like blueberries and chocolate. And although usually sweet, these pancakes can also be made savory depending on the ingredients added to the batter, as well as toppings and sides you decide to serve.

The preparation starts by mixing the dry ingredients — sifted flour, sugar, salt, baking soda and/or baking powder in one bowl, and the wet ingredients — bananas, eggs, milk or water, buttermilk, vanilla, and oil or solid fats in another. The dry and wet ingredients are then combined gently, followed by nuts and other additions such as raisins, seeds or spices. Finally, the batter is transferred to a lightly greased loaf pan and baked for approximately one hour at 350˚F (180°C).

The Original Buffalo Wings,"Although chicken wings were long marked as the least desirable part of the chicken, the Buffalo wings recipe turned them into a juicy, spicy treat perfect for a snack or an appetizer, especially during sports events. This simple dish is prepared by first separating the chicken wings at the joint into a drumstick and a flat. Then, the wings are deep-fried or baked in a hot oven until they turn golden brown and crispy. Originally, the wings are left unseasoned and uncoated with flour, although some recipe variations suggest doing so. The following step is to toss the wings into a hot sauce with some melted butter or margarine — or, even better, into special Anchor Bar Wing Sauce which is the authentic ingredient. The wings are tossed in the bowl until they are completely covered in sauce.

Also known as griddle cakes or bannocks in Scotland, traditional scones were made with oats, sugar, salt, milk, and butter as primary ingredients and baked on hot griddles. Later on, flour was introduced as a standard and traditionally legitimate stand-in for oats. Also, nowadays, most scones are baked in the oven. Depending on the variety, scones can be savory or sweet, containing dried fruits, lemon curd, honey, clotted cream, or different jams. Some of the most famous Scottish varieties of scones are drop scone (also known as Scotch pancakes, based on a batter-like mixture baked on a griddle/girdle) and tattie scone (or potato scone, with mashed potatoes added to the mix).

Ma'Amoul,"These shortbread cookies popular in Levantine countries can traditionally have one of three possible fillings: date, walnut, and pistachio. For easier identification, the cookies will be shaped differently according to the filling that's hiding inside. Ones that have a date filling are round, and with a flattened top, the dome-shaped ones contain a walnut filling, whereas those filled with pistachios are shaped like elongated ovals. The dough, which contains no sugar, is made with semolina flour, ghee, and yeast, and perfumed with rose and orange blossom water. Flattened oblongs or balls of dough are then shaped and decorated using tabbeh — a traditional wooden mold used to make ma’amouls — arranged on a baking tray, and baked about 20-30 minutes, taking care not to overbake because the top of the cookie must remain pale.

Chalupas Poblanas,"A traditional appetizer most commonly associated with the Mexican state of Puebla and its capital, Puebla de Zaragoza, chalupas are small corn tortillas fried in lard, and topped with a wide array of savory ingredients. The basic list includes red or green salsa (salsa roja and salsa verde), shredded pork, chicken or beef, chopped onion and sometimes even fresh cheese. However, the fillings and toppings may also include chorizo sausages, chilies, potatoes, mushrooms, refried beans, cilantro, and shredded lettuce. The first step when making chalupas is kneading a masa dough made with masa harina (a special kind of flour made of nixtamalized corn), some water, and salt. The dough is then divided and formed into small tortillas up to 10 cm in diameter, or into forms which resemble canoes. After being cooked in a comal, a cast-iron griddle, the tortillas are fried in lard to get a crunchy texture.

Traditional Ukranian Paska,"Both the Ukrainian paska and the Russian kulich, terms which are often used interchangeably, are a traditional Eastern sweet bread made with buttery, egg-rich, yeasted dough, similar to one used for making brioche. The basic ingredients are flour, eggs, butter, yeast, sugar, milk, and salt. However, there are some differences between the two in the ingredients, method, and presentation. Paska will usually have less butter, may include sour cream, and can be enriched with vanilla, ginger, rum, sultanas, lemon peel, or saffron, but many recipes exclude dried fruits, rum, and peels altogether. The dough is baked in a round baking pan, and the top is ornately decorated with decorative dough shapes — crosses, braids, suns, fertility symbols, etc. The dough is typically glazed with an egg wash before it's baked. Alternatively, paska may not include dough ornaments and is coated instead with a white glaze and topped with sprinkles. Kulich, on the other hand, will be more buttery, airy, and will include more additional ingredients such as raisins, sultanas, almonds, and saffron. The raisins are usually rehydrated in rum which is also added to the dough. The dough is placed in either smaller or larger tins, depending on the preference. The still hot kulich is brushed with a glaze made with either powdered sugar and lemon juice, or a mixture of powdered sugar, lemon juice, and an egg white. Before the glaze has had time to set, it is usually topped with sprinkles or slivered almonds. The top of kulich is often adorned with the letters XB, meaning Христос воскрес (lit. Christ is risen). For serving, paska is paired with a custard-like cheese hrudka and is typically eaten with kovbasa or Eastern ham, while Kulich is traditionally served with a sweet cheese spread paskha.","Ukraine, Europe",4.7,"['1 ½ cups (360 ml) milk', '1/2 tps sugar', '1/2 cup (100g) sugar', '1/2 cup (120 ml) water (lukewarm)', '1 package yeast (active dry)', '7 ½ cups (900g) flour (all-purpose)', '3 large eggs (room-temperature, beaten)', '1/3 cup (75g) butter (melted)', '1 ½ tsp salt', '1 large egg (room-temperature)']",12,20min,55min,5h 10min,6h 25min,TasteAtlas,"['Heat milk over medium heat and remove it from the stove just as it’s about to start boiling.

At this point, the heat is set to low, and the mixture is constantly stirred until thickened, about 15-20 minutes. The sugar and the flavorings are added at the end. When slightly cooled, the mehalabiya is poured into a large glass dish, or into individual bowls or glasses.

They are traditionally fried in lard or tallow, but frying them in butter or oil is a more common practice these days. When served as a main dish, they are typically paired with boiled potatoes, brown sauce, pickled beetroot, and cooked red cabbage.

Belev Pastila,"Pastila is a traditional Russian fruit confectionery made with apples, sugar, and egg whites (optional). Simplicity at its finest, this natural fruit-based candy takes little effort to make. It is also one of the healthier desserts since it is naturally gluten-free, low in calories, and rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Additionally, if egg whites are excluded, pastila can be vegan as well. Traditionally, pastila is made with Antonov apples, an acidic sort that grows only in Russia. However, newer adaptations of the recipe include other types of fruits, such as pears, plums, apricots, currants, rowan berries, and lingonberries, and condiments like cinnamon and vanilla sugar that add more richness to the flavor. Lately, a vegetable-based pastila has also gained popularity. When it comes to the ingredients, pastila recipes significantly diverge, but preparation methods largely remain the same. The more traditional practice calls for drying the apple purée above 50°C/120°F, whereas the second method proposes drying the purée at a temperature below 50°C/120°F. Due to its spongy texture, pastila is often compared with marshmallow or zefir, although its texture is somewhat airier and lighter. Pastila can be bought in virtually every store in Russia, but making a batch at home is a worthwhile endeavor, mainly because it is not a particularly technical dish to pull off. What it does require, however, is a fair share of time and patience. Pastila needs about 10 hours to set and get dry. After it has been dried, it can either be served or stored in an airtight container in which it can last for months.","Kolomna, Russia",4.1,"['3 kg (6.6 lbs) Antonov apples (or any acidic sort)', '400g (2 cups) sugar', '4 egg whites', 'icing sugar, as needed']",10,1h,13h,-,14h,TasteAtlas,"['Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F.', 'Wash, dry, and peel the apples.

Mofongo,"Green plantain, pork cracklings chicharrón, garlic, and salt is all you need to make mofongo. However, there is, thankfully, more than one way to make it. Often, olive oil or chicken broth is added to moisten the mixture a bit, and sometimes a ripe plantain is used instead of a green one, while the use of either cassava, taro, eddoe, breadfruit, or a mixture of plantains and cassava instead of plantains is also quite widespread. Also, mofongo can have a seafood or a meat filling — alternatively, these can be just poured over a mofongo — in which case we are talking of mofongo relleno. The preparation starts with frying the plantain slices until golden, then mashing them in a pilón, a special mortar from Puerto Rico. Once mashed a bit, garlic, pork cracklings, and salt are added, and the mixture is mashed some more until well combined. The mixture is then shaped into a dome and typically served with fried meat on top and broth soup on the side.","Puerto Rico, North America",4.6,"['4 green plantains', '1 lb of chicharrón (crunchy pork skin)', '3 garlic cloves, mashed', '4 tsp of olive oil', '2 cups frying oil']",4,10min,20min,-,30min,TasteAtlas,"['Peel the plantains and cut them into 1 ½-inch slices.

Bacon Cheese Fries,"Typically eaten for either lunch or dinner, cheese fries is an American fast-food item made with French fries which are topped with melted cheese and other various toppings such as bacon bits, grilled onions, and jalapeño slices. The cheese of choice is Cheddar cheese, but different cheese varieties can be used, the only requirement being that they are a good melting cheese. To prepare, all that is required is to pour the melted cheese (often mixed with other ingredients and spices), or a cheese sauce, over the fries.

The Traditional Victoria Sponge,"The Victoria sponge cake (a.k.a. Victoria sandwich) was popular with both adults and children during Victorian high tea. Made with equal parts eggs, flour, sugar, and fat, plus baking powder, the Victoria sponge is basically made the same way as pound cake. And while the original Victoria sponge, as Queen Victoria would have it, only consists of two cake layers with a strawberry or raspberry jam center, most modern recipe variations also add a spread of buttercream. Also, other than a dusting of caster sugar, the cake has no other decorations or icings. However, the cake has spread worldwide, and over the years, variations have developed, mainly regarding the filling. Some of those variations call for such fillings as lemon curd, cream and strawberries, apricot jam, whipped cream, and other flavored creams.

Irish Stew,"Widely regarded as a poor man's meal, Irish stew is based on what most Irish people had on hand during difficult times — sheep meat (usually mutton, as lamb or goat meat was considered a luxury), potatoes, and onions. If the opportunity allowed, the aroma of the stew was decorated with additions such as carrots, leeks, cabbage, parsley, chives, turnips, thyme, or even barley grains. Even though the number of additions to the two essential ingredients (meat and potatoes) is a subject of debate on what amount makes the stew traditional, it is up to personal preference or circumstances. If anything, it shows the resourcefulness of the people who made the Irish stew into what it is today. As a staple of the everyday diet for many generations, Irish stew has many variations. Many Irish families keep records of their own recipes with unique twists and tweaks to the stew's disarmingly simple formula. In America, where many Irish people moved over the last two centuries, mutton or lamb meat is often replaced with beef. Many traditional Irish pubs offer Irish stew with an addition of another Irish staple lending its aroma to the broth – the famous Guinness stout.","Ireland, Europe",4,"['1.5kg (3 1/3 lbs) mutton or lamb chops, cut into 2.5cm (1-inch) dices', '1kg (2.2 lbs) potatoes, peeled and cut into halves (or smaller sections if large)', '3 to 4 medium onions, roughly chopped', '3 to 4 carrots, cut into thick angled slices, optional', 'salt, to taste', 'ground black pepper, to taste', 'water, as needed']",4,20min,1h,-,1h 20min,TasteAtlas,"['Prepare a large-sized Dutch oven or a casserole dish and fill it with water.', 'Add the potato, the meat, and enough water to cover the ingredients.

Classic Vol-Au-Vent In The Style Of Carême,"The vol-au-vent, which means windblown, is a French dish that can be served both as an appetizer (with savory fillings) or as a dessert if the fillings are sweet. The very first step in the preparation of the vol-au-vent is making the puff pastry or the flaky pastry. Flour is combined with salt and water to make an elastic, silky dough, which is then covered in butter, rolled, and turned for at least six rounds until it reaches its characteristic layered consistency. The puff pastry is then formed into round chimney-like structures made out of a bottom, disc-shaped layer and the top layer in the form of a ring glued together with water. The remaining smaller disc left from the center of the ring is used as a lid. During baking, the pastry rises and creates a cylinder cavity that can be filled with meat, fish, or vegetable-based sauces, often enhanced with wine or liqueurs.","Paris, France",4.6,"['500g (1.1 lbs) flour', '300 ml (1 ¼ cup) water', '1 ½ tsp salt', '500g (1.1 lbs) butter', '1 egg', 'lean ham', 'pinch of mignonette', 'thyme', 'bay leaf', 'mushroom and truffle trimmings', '2 tbsp consommé', '2 ½ glasses dry Madeira']",6,1h,1h,5h 20min,7h 20min,TasteAtlas,"['First, prepare the puff pastry.

Donauwelle,"Made of layers of vanilla and chocolate pound cake, sour cherries, German buttercream, and chocolate glaze, donauwelle, or Danube wave cake in English, is a classic German and Austrian sheet cake. The preparation starts with making pound cake consisting of vanilla and chocolate batter that are poured one on top of the other to create a marbled effect. The sour cherries are pressed into the batter, and the whole thing is baked. Once cooled, it is spread with German buttercream, which is basically vanilla pudding custard mixed with creamed butter. Finally, the chocolate glaze is poured over the cake in preferably two layers, and before the glaze is fully set, a wavy pattern is made in the glaze by running a fork through it. Donauwelle is also known as Schneewittchenkuchen, or Snow White cake in English, because the colors of the cake, black, red, and white, are the same as the colors of Snow White’s complexion and hair. However, a cake bearing that name has a variation where instead of German buttercream, the cake is spread with cream with quark and topped with a cherry juice glaze.

Other than with customary cinnamon and sugar, apples can be seasoned with honey, molasses, allspice, nutmeg, grated ginger, and even orange or lemon zest.

Barbecue Snags,"Snags are mildly flavored Australian sausages typically made with a mixture of beef and pork, though other kinds do exist as well, like ones that are all beef or ones made with a more upscale combination of fillings such as lamb and rosemary or beef and red wine.

Also, some recipes advise that the sausages be simmered in water first for 30 minutes before they are grilled, and for a simpler at home preparation, frying them in a pan will also produce good results.

Palacsinta,"Because they can be whipped up in a matter of minutes and with ingredients found in every pantry, no wonder Hungarians serve these pancakes for any meal of the day, whether as an appetizer, main course, or dessert. Since they can be filled with almost any ingredient imaginable, they are incredibly versatile and can be either savory and sweet. The basic batter is made with flour, eggs, milk, salt, and water, though sparkling water, sugar, and oil can be added as well. Once the batter is made, it is important that it rests in the refrigerator anywhere from 30 minutes to overnight, depending on the recipe, but the longer, the better. Pancakes are cooked on a heated and oiled pan, then filled with the filling of choice, either savory or sweet. Some of the most popular savory fillings include ham, mushrooms, meat, usually leftover meat stew pörkölt, while fruit jams, cocoa, poppy seeds, walnuts, and even chestnut are used as a filling if palacsinta is served as a dessert. Some of the most noted types of sweet palacsinta include Gundel palacsinta which is filled with walnut and poured over with chocolate sauce and rakott palacsinta, a layered pancake cake, usually with a fruit jam, ground walnuts, poppy seeds, and cottage cheese filling.

Mac And Cheese,"The first step in preparing this American staple is to make the sauce. The base is a simple béchamel sauce made from butter, flour, and milk, which is then turned into a Mornay sauce (another French classic) by adding grated or shredded cheese, usually cheddar. The prepared sauce is poured over boiled macaroni — elbow macaroni is the traditional choice — and tossed to make sure the pasta is evenly coated. The dish can be served like this, but the resulting mass is usually put into a casserole dish, sprinkled with breadcrumbs, and baked until the top has a lovely golden crust, and the insides are bubbly. The sauce can be made as thick or as thin as one prefers; it can be modified to include different cheese varieties; or be flavored with spices and herbs.

Original Caesar Salad,"Although the preparation of Caesar salad is quite simple, this dish was considered glamorous because, in Caesar’s restaurant, it was usually prepared ceremonially in front of the guests. The first step is to wash and dry Romaine lettuce and chill it in the refrigerator, leaving the leaves whole. Garlic oil is prepared by crushing garlic cloves and leaving them in salad oil; the pieces of garlic need to be removed before seasoning. Croutons are made by cutting French bread into small cubes and baking them shortly in an oven until they turn golden brown, and the Parmesan cheese should be freshly grated. Other seasonings include pre-made Worcestershire sauce, olive oil, salt, and pepper. In the end, some lemon juice and one raw egg are added, and the salad is mixed gently but thoroughly.

Hot fudge sundae, created by heating the flavored syrup before drizzling it over the ice cream, is a sundae variation usually made with chocolate, caramel, or butterscotch sauce.

Foie Gras Au Torchon,"According to French law, foie gras is defined as a liver of a duck or goose that's been fattened through a process called gavage, which is a method of force-feeding corn with a feeding tube. Also, foie gras comes in various, legally defined presentations. There are whole liver lobes, one or two, called foie gras entier, liver pieces which are reassembled together are labeled just as foie gras, while a cooked, moulded block with 98% or more foie gras is called bloc de foie gras. In case it is labeled avec morceaux it is mandatory that it contains at least 50% of goose foie gras pieces or in case of duck, 30%. Pâté de foie gras and mousse de foie gras should have at least 50% if not more of foie gras, while 75% of foie gras or more should be used in parfait de foie gras. When it comes to cooking foie gras, there are many techniques out there, and they are usually divided into hot and cold preparations. Some cook foie gras completely as in the case of searing, while others are raw preparations, as in the case of foie gras au torchon. However, the most traditional and popular is foie gras terrine, where foie gras is cooked in a bain-marie and then cooled in the refrigerator for at least a day. Foie gras mousse is also quite popular, as well as pâté of foie gras. Usually served as an appetizer, foie gras can be eaten hot or cold and is typically paired with toasted bread, and sweet or red wines. Also, depending on the preparation, foie gras can also be served with various sauces, or with various fruit preserves and dried fruits.

It can be enjoyed in a myriad of different ways, whether hot as a side dish or cold as a topping for sandwiches or buckwheat crêpes. Since the vegetables used in this recipe are all exceptionally flavorful, ratatouille is usually seasoned only with sea salt, olive oil, and cracked pepper.

Yankee Pot Roast,"How ever easy it may appear at first glance, a pot roast requires not only time but also attention to detail if one wants it to turn out perfect. It is usually made with beef, but pork and lamb work just fine as well. However, only cheaper cuts of meat like brisket, chuck, and round roast should be used as they benefit from long braising due to lots of connective tissues that release collagen during cooking which makes for a meltingly tender meat and an excellent gravy. Root vegetables like carrots, potatoes, onions, parsnips, and turnips are typically called for, but there is no limit to what kinds of vegetables can be added. Other ingredients include stock, red wine, tomatoes or tomato paste, and various aromatics and seasonings such as bay leaf, thyme, and rosemary. The preparation starts with searing the meat in a pot, then sautéeing the onions and herbs. The meat is then removed, and the pot is deglazed with red wine or stock, after which the meat is returned together with tomato paste. The stock is poured in, and the pot is covered with a lid, then placed in a preheated oven to cook for two to three hours over medium heat. Vegetables are added no more than half an hour before the end of cooking, so they do not turn mushy. When done, the meat is sliced or pulled apart in chunks and arranged on a plate together with the vegetables and then poured over with the stock that can be thickened with butter and flour.

"Unsweetened, Southern-Style Cornbread","Mainly associated with the South, in its simplest and most traditional form cornbread — also known as corn pone — is made from cornmeal, salt, and water batter and is baked in a cast iron skillet over an open fire. Today, there is a general divide on how cornbread is prepared depending on where you are in the United States. In the South, the batter is prepared with white cornmeal, sometimes buttermilk, and little to no sugar, while in the North they will use yellow cornmeal, and add wheat flour, eggs, milk or buttermilk, a leavening agent, and some sugar, which gives for a sweeter, more cake-like cornbread. The most popular way to cook cornbread, however, is to skillet-bake it, meaning the prepared batter is poured into a hot, greased cast-iron skillet and then baked until the cornbread is lightly brown. Albeit, cornbread, and its many derivatives — hush puppies, johnnycakes, and spoon bread — can also be baked, fried, or steamed, depending on the recipe. This bread can be served a myriad of different ways. It can be steeped in milk or buttermilk and eaten with a spoon for breakfast, or served as a side with barbecue, chili con carne, and pinto beans. In the South, they eat it with molasses, while in the Northern regions of United States they pair it with honey. Besides being a side to almost any meal imaginable, cornbread is also used as stuffing for Thanksgiving, especially in the South.","United States Of America, North America",4.1,"['3 cups stone-ground cornmeal', '2 tsp kosher salt', '2 tsp baking powder', '3/4 tsp baking soda', '3 tsp sugar (optional)', '2 ½ cups buttermilk', '3 eggs', '1 ½ sticks of unsalted butter, melted, divided']",12,20min,45min,-,1h 5min,TasteAtlas,"['Set the oven to preheat to 375°F, then place a well-seasoned, 12-inch cast iron skilled on the middle rack of the oven.', 'Next, add cornmeal, salt, baking powder, baking soda, and sugar if you’re using it to a large bowl, then whisk to combine.', 'Take a separate bowl, add to it buttermilk and eggs and while continuously whisking, drizzle in all of the melted butter in, except for one tablespoon.', 'Pour the liquid ingredients into the dry ones, and whisk just until combined.

Traditional Easter Babka,"Moist, spongy and bright yellow, babka is a sweet bread commonly served for Easter in Poland, Ukraine, Belarus and other Central and Eastern European countries. According to Polish Heritage Cookery, the term babka covers a wide range of cakes which need to be taller than they are wide, and be narrower at the top than at the bottom. The preparation of babka starts with mixing yeast with sugar, flour, and milk. The mixture is then left to rise in a warm place. Next, the egg yolks are mixed with sugar and sometimes salt, until they become light yellow and foamy. Yeast and egg yolk mixtures are combined with flour, melted butter, and other additions such as rum, raisins, various candied fruits or citrus peels. Then, the dough can be left to rise. Some recipes suggest doing three rounds, while others do not insist on this step. The dough is transferred into a babka pan which is similar to a classic bundt pan and can have either straight or pleated sides. The babka is baked for 30 to 45 minutes at 170 to 175˚C (340-350°F) and left to cool. After being removed from the baking pan, babka can be dusted with icing sugar or covered in icing before serving.","Poland, Europe",4.5,"['500g (1.1 lb) flour', '8 egg yolks', '50g (1.75 oz) yeast', '200g (7 oz) melted butter', '150g (5.3 oz) sugar', '3/4 cup (180 ml) warm milk', '100g (3.5 oz) candied peel', 'fat, for greasing', 'breadcrumbs']",6,20min,30min,-,50min,TasteAtlas,"['Mix 1/2 cup flour, 1 tbsp sugar, yeast and milk and leave it to rise in a warm place.', 'In the meantime, mix the egg yolks with the remaining sugar until foamy.', 'Stir in the risen yeast mixture and the remaining flour.

Tamagoyaki,"The Japanese version of an omelet, tamagoyaki, may require some skill and practice to perfect because a beginner may not get the desired results, at first try, at least. The eggs are whisked using chopsticks together with sugar, salt, soy sauce, and mirin, but seasonings do vary from household to household. To prepare, a thin layer of the egg mixture is then poured into a greased rectangular omelet pan called a makiyakinabe. Once the layer has set, it is carefully rolled into a log using chopsticks. However, it is important that the top of the layer does not dry out before rolling as the egg will not then stick together. Next, another layer of the egg mixture is poured into the pan, and the log is then rolled over that layer. This step is repeated until there is no egg mixture left at which point you transfer the log onto a plate, wait a few minutes for it to cool a bit, and then cut the ends off and slice the log into ½-inch pieces. Some like their tamagoyaki less sweet and may exclude sugar altogether, while some like the eggs sweeter and will up the amount of sugar. When dashi is added to the egg mixture, we are talking of dashimaki tamago, which may prove a challenge to prepare as the mixture is thinner than the one of a regular tamagoyaki. Tamagoyaki is typically served with grated daikon and some soy sauce. It is considered an essential component of a bentō box and is used in making sushi, or as a palate cleanser. In Japan, you can sample tamagoyaki in Japanese gastropubs izakaya and soba restaurants, but also purchase them in department stores.","Japan, Asia",4.7,"['4 large eggs', '1 tsp soy sauce', '1 tbsp mirin', '2 tsp sugar', '1/4 tsp salt', '1 tbsp vegetable oil']",1,5min,8min,-,13min,TasteAtlas,"['Whisk the eggs using either chopsticks or a fork together with soy sauce, mirin, sugar, and salt.', 'Pour the oil into a small bowl, then fold a paper towel and dip into the oil.

Chicken Fried Steak,"Today, a staple of Southern cuisine, chicken fried steak, despite its name is not made with chicken, but traditionally, with tenderized beef round. The meat is dredged in flour, then fried in lard, and served ladled with white gravy and mashed potatoes. Sirloin, cube steak, or even more expensive cuts like rib-eye or porterhouse are sometimes used instead of the round, though such finer cuts are not in line with the philosophy of the dish. Also, although the meat is traditionally dredged in flour only once, most people like a richer, thicker coating, so they dredge the meat twice in flour, and once in the egg and milk mixture. Sometimes buttermilk is used instead of the eggs and milk, and flour is commonly seasoned with pepper, paprika, and other seasonings, depending on the recipe.

Baked Ziti By Lidia Bastianich,"Cheesy, saucy, hearty, and filling, baked ziti is a classic of the Italian-American cuisine, a layered casserole consisting of, at its most basic, ziti pasta, tomato sauce, and three types of cheese: mozzarella, ricotta, and parmesan. The preparation starts with cooking the ziti pasta, usually only until halfway done since it will bake later as well. The tomato sauce is made next, and ricotta is often stirred into it before the dish is assembled. All the ingredients are then layered in a baking dish with mozzarella as the final layer. The assembled dish is baked in a preheated oven for up to 30 minutes and should be served once it's had at least five minutes of rest. Variations on the basic include adding ground meat, which can be cooked separately or with the sauce, various cooked vegetables, bacon, mushrooms, or using additional or different types of cheese.

Traditional English Trifle By Delia Smith,"A mélange of colors, textures, and flavors, trifle is a signature British dessert that although incredibly easy to prepare, makes for a stunning presentation, on any table, and on any occasion. When assembling, a layer of sponge cake, typically flavored with sherry or Madeira wine and often spread with jam, is placed on the bottom. Next, fruits such as strawberries, oranges, nectarines, blueberries, and cherries which can be fresh or canned are placed on the sponge, followed by custard or pastry cream which is poured over. To finish, a layer of whipped cream and garnish in the form of candied fruits, flowers, and nuts, such as glacé cherries, angelica, and chopped almonds are placed on top. Variations include using, for example, different flavored fruit jellies to suspend the sponge and the fruit, using macaroons instead of sponges, or using different kinds of fruits, or even, forgoing the fruit entirely.

Classic Spaghetti And Meatballs,"Spaghetti, meatballs, and tomato sauce are the components of spaghetti and meatballs, one of the most recognizable representatives of Italian-American cuisine. The sauce is usually made first and can, besides tomatoes, include onions, garlic, wine, and red pepper flakes for heat. While the sauce is cooking, the meatballs are prepared. Most recipes call for the use of a combination of beef, pork, and veal, but meatballs can be made only with one kind of meat if one prefers. The meat is combined with bread or breadcrumbs previously soaked in milk, cheese, either one kind of multiple kinds, eggs, sometimes garlic, and aromatics such as parsley, oregano, and pepper. The meat mixture is shaped into meatballs which are first seared, then dropped into the prepared sauce and simmered just so the flavors can blend and mingle, and the meatballs are cooked through.

Classic Tulumba,"Deep fried in oil and dipped in sugar syrup, tulumba is a Turkish dessert which can, surprisingly, be crispy, soft, and juicy at the same time. Similar to Spanish churros and Italian zeppole or fritelle, this Ramadan specialty is prepared with dough very similar to choux pastry. The process starts with making the syrup by melting sugar in water with some lemon juice. When the syrup starts turning dark, it is cooled down in a refrigerator until tulumba is finished. The dough for tulumba is made by mixing water, butter, sugar and salt in a pot until they start to boil, after which the flour, eggs, and semolina are stirred in. The dough may contain lemon juice or even vinegar, but it can also be prepared without them. Next, the dough is placed in a piping bag with a star-shaped nozzle, which gives the tulumba its distinctive shape. Good timing is crucial in the following step: tulumba pastries are fried in deep vegetable oil until they are crispy on the outside, but still soft on the inside.

However, it turned out that gaz-angebin is, in fact, an exudate of an insect called tamarisk manna scale, which inhabits that specific kind of tree. The females produce a sweet, sticky liquid which hardens when exposed to air and resembles a tree sap. This exotic ingredient is harvested from late summer to early autumn. Then, it is sieved, boiled, and strained, after which it is ready for use. Since it is quite rare and expensive, nowadays it is replaced with a combination of sugar and corn or glucose syrup, which yields the same result. The preparation process starts with whipping the egg whites into firm snow. Sugar, corn or glucose syrup, and sometimes honey, are melted over medium heat into a thick syrup, which is combined with the egg whites in a long, labor-intensive process which was made easier with the appearance of stand mixers. Rose water and nuts — most commonly, pistachios and almonds — are stirred in, and the gaz mixture is ready to be shaped. When it comes to shaping, a traditional approach is to roll gaz by hand into long, round strips which are then cut into small pieces around 2-inches in diameter and about 1/2-inch thick. A modern approach suggests cutting gaz into small, bite-sized cubes. Usually, gaz is paired with tea or sherbet and served as an everyday dessert or on various festive occasions, such as Nowruz — Persian New Year. A beautifully decorated box of gaz is an appreciated gift among Iranians and a popular souvenir among tourists.","Isfahan, Iran",3.9,"['2 egg whites', '1 cup sugar', '1/2 cup glucose or corn syrup', '2 tbsp water', '1 ½ cup sugar', '1 ½ cup corn syrup (or glucose syrup)', '1 ½ cup almonds or pistachios, blanched and toasted', '2 tbsp butter or ghee, melted', '2 tsp rose water or vanilla extract']",12,25min,40min,-,1h 5min,TasteAtlas,"['Grease one baking pan and one large bowl with butter.', 'First, make the meringue.

Original Provençal Tapenade,"Preparing tapenade is a no-brainer: olives, capers, and anchovies are pounded together until they form a thick purée, and the liquid ingredients — olive oil and lemon juice — are added gradually at the end. Traditional preparation calls for a mortar and a pestle, but by using a blender, you can have your tapenade ready in a matter of seconds. A South-French specialty, tapenade can be made with black or green olives, which need to be pitted and well-drained before preparation. Since olives and anchovies are salty enough, there is no need to add salt — a pinch of pepper will do. A hint of acidity is brought by pickled capers (which are flower buds of the namesake plant) and a drizzle of lemon. Some recipes suggest adding some finely minced garlic and a spoonful of mustard, but these might come as a distraction to the original taste. The density of tapenade can be adjusted by dosing the amount of olive oil — the idea is to reach a consistency of a spread that will hold firmly on toast, sliced baguette, or bread sticks which are a usual serving proposal. Tapenade can also be used as a filling for hard-boiled eggs, as an addition to various sauces, or as a meat filling, and, since its preparation is rather simple, the most important factor is to purchase the best-quality ingredients you can buy.","Provence, France",4.4,"['200g (7 oz) black olives, pitted', '3 tbsp capers', '4 garlic cloves', '2 anchovy fillets', '12 tbsp olive oil', '2 tbsp Cognac']",4,5min,-,-,5min,TasteAtlas,"['Add all the ingredients to the bowl of your food processor and mix.', 'While mixing, gradually add the olive oil and the cognac — this is the key to the success of your tapenade.', 'Vary the texture: mix until you get a slightly grainy tapenade or longer for a smoother tapenade.']",https://www.tasteatlas.com/tapenade/recipe,https://www.tasteatlas.com/images/recipes/9a4d936466d3463aaae9f7ab1d9cead6.jpg?mw=910
Classic Nagasaki Champon,"Typical for the Japanese city of Nagasaki, champon is a rich, filling noodle dish with pork, seafood, and vegetables simmered in a savory broth. Generally, it belongs in the ramen dish family, and the main element which differentiates it from ramen is the fact that all the ingredients are cooked in the same pot or wok. The first step is frying the ingredients in lard — generally, the meat, cabbage, carrots, and onions are fried first, followed by more delicate ingredients such as seafood, sprouts, and mushrooms. Then, a stock seasoned with soy sauce, mirin, and sake is poured in, and the ingredients are simmered shortly before the finishing touch — the addition of champon noodles. Champon is served piping hot in deep serving bowls, and has several regional varieties. The cities of Tottori and Amagasaki season it with extra soy sauce, in Akita miso soup is used instead of broth, while in the city of Okinawa topping includes a scrambled egg, and noodles are substituted with rice.","Nagasaki, Japan",4.3,"['100 g pork', '2 small oysters', '40 g prawns', '120 g cabbage', '1 kikurage (wood ear) mushroom', '2 spring onions', '80 g onion', '40 g kamaboko', '120 g bean sprouts', '4 tsp lard', '1,6 l chicken stock', '3 tbsp soy sauce', '2 tbsp sake', '1,5 tsp salt', 'pepper, to taste', '4 packs champon noodles']",4,10min,20min,-,30min,TasteAtlas,"['Cut the pork into bite-sized pieces.

Classic New Mexico Breakfast Burrito,"Conceived in Mexico and born in New Mexico, USA, breakfast burrito is a hearty dish that could easily be mistaken for lunch or dinner. It is hearty, satiable, versatile, and often spicy and filled with calories. Preparing a breakfast burrito starts with a humble corn or wheat tortilla, and the filling ingredients depend on the region and, of course, personal preferences. For instance, in New Mexico, breakfast burritos are filled with eggs, meat, and potatoes, and smothered in red and green chile sauce. The potatoes can be shredded or cut into cubes but must be fried and crispy. Bacon is the most common meat choice, but chorizo sausages, ham, carne asada, and other pork varieties are also an option. Cheese — usually Monterrey Jack or cheddar — is either packed into a burrito or sprinkled on top and melted in the oven. Other fillings include avocados, beans, spinach, tomatoes, peppers, and soft cheeses such as feta or goat cheese. Generally, the breakfast burrito is a savory dish, but sweet varieties also exist. The breakfast burrito is usually prepared in two ways, either as a handheld version, practical for a breakfast on the go because all the ingredients are packed inside the burrito, or smothered in sauce and melted cheese, served on a shallow plate, in which case it is eaten with a fork.","Santa Fe, United States Of America",4.3,"['1⁄4 cup (60 ml) vegetable oil', '3 large russet potatoes, shredded', '1⁄2 tsp salt', 'freshly ground black pepper', '1 medium onion, chopped', '1 garlic clove, minced', '2-3 large eggs, lightly beaten', '4 flour tortillas, warmed', '8 slices bacon, cooked until crisp', '6-8 oz (170 - 225g) mild cheddar cheese, grated', '2 tbsp vegetable oil', '1 medium onion, finely chopped', '2-3 garlic cloves, minced', '1 tbsp all-purpose flour', '2 cups (480g) chopped roasted mild to medium-hot New Mexican green chile, fresh or thawed frozen', '2 cups (480 ml) chicken or beef stock', '1⁄2 tsp salt, or more to taste', '8 oz (225g) (20-25 pcs) dried whole red New Mexican chile pods', '4 cups (1 L) water or chicken stock (divided use)', '2 tbsp vegetable oil', '1 medium onion, minced', '3 garlic cloves, minced', '1-2 tsp crumbled dried Mexican oregano or marjoram', '1 tsp salt, or more to taste']",4,15min,1h 30min,-,1h 45min,TasteAtlas,"['Start with preparing the green and red chile sauce.', 'For the green chile sauce, sauté onion and garlic in a saucepan over medium heat for about 5 minutes, until the onion becomes soft.

White Russian,"Made with vodka, coffee liqueur, and cream, the White Russian is a cocktail typically served in an Old-Fashioned glass. The proportions of the ingredients do vary from recipe to recipe, as there is no one fixed recipe. Some call for equal parts of all three, as is the case of the first known recipe for the cocktail, while others variate the proportions, typically vodka making up the biggest portion of the drink. The brands of coffee liqueur that are most commonly used are Kahlúa and Tia Maria, although most cocktail buffs prefer to make their own liqueur. Also, even though cream is the typical ingredient, half and half and milk are often used instead. The usual way of making this cocktail is to first, fill a glass with ice, then add the vodka and the coffee liqueur and mix them with a spoon. The cream is then floated over ice, and the drink is gently stirred, so the black and white layer remain somewhat separate. Alternatively, the cream is shaken so it stiffens a bit before it's poured into a cocktail, while vodka and the coffee liqueur can be shaken in a shaker before they are poured into a glass. Some recipes call for the three ingredients to be first mixed in a shaker and then double strained into an ice-filled glass.","California, United States Of America",4.4,"['5 cl (50 ml) (1 2/3 oz) vodka', '2 cl (20 ml) (2/3 oz) coffee liqueur', 'cream, as desired (about 3 cl) (30 ml) (1 oz)']",1,5min,-,-,5min,TasteAtlas,"['Fill an Old-Fashioned glass with ice, then add the vodka and the coffee liqueur, and stir.', 'Float the cream over the ice, then carefully stir.']",https://www.tasteatlas.com/white-russian/recipe,-
Traditional Peach Cobbler,"As a dessert developed literary ""on the road"", peach cobbler is prepared with only the most basic ingredients. This fruit dessert is essentially a deep-dish fruit casserole consisting of sugar-sprinkled peaches covered with a layer of rough biscuit dough or pie dough, baked in an oven until golden. Its trademark juiciness comes from the fact that the peaches and sugar release a thick syrup during baking. Old fashion recipe versions suggested inverting the peach cobbler, so the fruit ends up on top. Modern variations, on the other hand, propose either peaches on the bottom and dough on the top or preparing a batter similar to the one used for cakes, placing the fruit on it, and letting the batter rise during baking to envelop the peaches. The process starts with dicing or slicing the peaches, which are then placed on a bottom of a deep dish baking pan, sprinkled with sugar, and covered with butter. Lemon juice, cinnamon, and nutmeg can be added to accentuate the flavor. Next, the dough is prepared by mixing flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt, then adding butter and milk or heavy cream. The dough can be transferred on top of the peaches by using a spoon, or it can be rolled with a rolling pin to form a sheet. The cobbler is then baked until its top gets a golden hue, and it is most commonly served warm or tepid with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.","United States Of America, North America",4.3,"['3 cups (450g) peaches, peeled and sliced', '1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar', '1/4 cup (4 tbsp) butter, cut into small pieces + more for buttering the baking dish', '1 cup (120g) all-purpose flour', '2 tsp baking powder', '1 tbsp granulated sugar', '1 tsp salt', '1/4 cup (4 tbsp) butter', '1/2 cup (120 ml) (or less) heavy cream']",6,10min,35min,-,45min,TasteAtlas,"['Butter a 1 1/2-quart (1.4 L) baking dish and cover the bottom with a layer of peaches.

Naturally Leavened Colomba Pasquale,"Colomba pasquale, also known as colomba di Pasqua, is a naturally-leavened artisanal sweet bread commonly found on Italian dining tables during Easter (Pasqua). Due to its dove-like shape and Easter-related origins, the cake became known as colomba pasquale, meaning Easter dove. Much like traditional Italian Christmas cakes pandoro and panettone, colomba pasquale is a delicate, soft, and fragrant cake made with simple ingredients such as wheat flour, eggs, sugar, salt, butter, mother yeast, and candied orange peel. The fact that colomba pasquale is a registered PAT product (the cake’s ingredients and characteristics are regulated by law) shows just how big of a staple of the Italian culture the cake has become. Similar to pandoro and panettone, colomba pasquale is a naturally leavened and time-consuming delicacy to make. The dough is based on mother yeast and is prepared in two stages in which the main ingredients such as flour, butter, and egg yolks are gradually incorporated. Although the original colomba pasquale uses a few ingredients, common variations call for the addition of honey, milk, cocoa butter, and vanilla to the dough. Traditionally, colomba pasquale is glazed with almond-based icing, topped with whole almonds and crystal sugar, and baked in a dove-shaped mold. Colomba is best served with sweet wines such as Oltrepò Moscato, Moscato d’Asti, or Passito di Pantelleria.","Milan, Italy",4.1,"['1 tbsp (15g) acacia honey', '1 vanilla bean, seeds scraped out', '1 orange, zest', '8.1 oz (230g) 00 flour 350W - P/L 0.55', '4 oz (115 ml) water', '2.3 oz (65g) mother yeast', '5 tbsp (70g) granulated sugar', '2.5 oz (70g) butter', '1.75 oz (50g) egg yolks (about 3)', 'first dough', '2 oz (60g) 00 flour 350W - P/L 0.55', '1/5 tbsp (1g) barley malt', '4 tbsp (60g) granulated sugar', '3 oz (85g) egg yolks', '1/2 tsp (3g) salt', 'aroma emulsion', '3.5 oz (100g) butter', '6.2 oz (175g) cubed candied orange', '4 tbsp (25g) almond flour', '4 oz (120g) icing sugar', '1.6 oz (45g) egg whites']",10,-,2h,-,2h,TasteAtlas,"['Prepare the aromatic emulsion one day in advance.

Baleada,"Often nicknamed the poor man's burrito, baleada consists of a thick flour tortilla that is first spread with mashed refried red beans, then sprinkled with Honduran hard, salty cheese (queso duro) and topped with a dollop or two of mantequilla crema, a form of salty Honduran sour cream. The tortilla is then folded in half, and baleada is ready to serve. Tortillas are typically made only with flour, salt, baking powder, oil, and some type of liquid, either water, milk, or coconut milk. Alternatively, tortilla recipes can include eggs, sugar, and butter instead of oil. Depending on the region and the type of ingredients added to the tortilla, baleadas can be classified into three different subgroups. Simple baleadas, as described earlier, can turn into special baleadas if you add scrambled eggs to the filling. The third subgroup is the super special baleadas. They are the type of baleadas that can have an almost unending list of additional ingredients — from vegetables such as plantains, avocado, bell peppers, onions, or vegetable salsa chismol, to meats like pork, beef, sausages, and grilled meat.

Traditional Fritule With Yeasted Dough,"Fritule, sweet round fritters from Dalmatia are a festive treat, traditionally prepared for Christmas and carnival time. The typical fritters are made with a yeasted dough that can be enriched with eggs, although in the past, it was more commonly prepared with choux pastry that could also include potatoes. However, today, it is frequently prepared with a looser dough that has yogurt and baking powder as ingredients instead of yeast. The key ingredient that needs to be included no matter what dough is used is alcohol, typically brandy — but rum or white wine are also an option — which helps the fritters not soak up as much oil during frying. Nuts, grated apples, spices, and citrus peels are often added to the dough for more flavor and moisture. Traditionally, fritule were fried in lard, but nowadays, oil is typically used. Once fried, fritule are left to drain on paper towels, and while hot, they are traditionally rolled in granulated or powdered sugar.

Simple Blueberry Cobbler,"Modest and easy to make, the blueberry cobbler is a dessert that requires no exotic ingredients, just some flour, sugar, salt, baking soda, butter, cornstarch, milk, and, of course, blueberries — fresh or frozen. First, the blueberries are scattered on the bottom of a deep baking pan and covered with some sugar and cornstarch, which thickens the juice released during baking and prevents the cobbler from becoming soggy. Next, dollops of batter are placed on top of the blueberries: the batter is made by mixing the dry ingredients such as flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt with some milk and butter until just combined. There is no need to put in extra effort to make the batter smooth — it actually needs to be rough and cobbled, just as the name says. Another method suggests placing the blueberries on top of the batter: to prevent them from sinking, roll them in some flour. The blueberry cobbler is then baked at 350°F/180°C for 45 to 50 minutes, or until the top becomes golden brown: note that with fresh blueberries, this amount of time may be even shorter.

Classic Hamburger,"The basic hamburger consists of nothing more than a beef patty tucked inside a bread bun. However, this combination is rarely seen on menus anymore, as today, a hamburger will include various additional ingredients like lettuce, tomato, onions, bacon, various condiments like mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, relishes, and cheese in which case we are technically speaking of a cheeseburger. The beef patty made of minced meat can be either pan-fried, grilled or flame-broiled and may consist of only meat and seasoning, or have various other ingredients that act as binders such milk, eggs, or breadcrumb.

Classic BLT Sandwich,"Fast, simple and easy, the recipe for a BLT sandwich requires virtually no culinary knowledge or skill, but still manages to result in a dish that is both basic and rich. The preparation starts with lightly toasting the slices of bread, which can either be done in a toaster oven, a regular oven, or on a skillet. One side of toasted bread is then covered with mayonnaise, thin slices of tomato, lettuce (either shredded or in leaves) and broiled bacon slices. Another slice of the toasted bread covered in mayonnaise is placed on top, and the assembled sandwich is usually cut into triangles and sometimes fixated using a toothpick or a wooden stick. Just like many other simple recipes, the BLT sandwich also relies on the quality of its ingredients. A common mistake is to consider the BLT to be a bacon sandwich seasoned with lettuce and tomato, when in fact tomato is the basic ingredient which carries most of the character, and every other ingredient is in its service. Therefore, the tomatoes should be ripe and firm, and their flavor can be enhanced with seasoning them directly with salt and freshly ground pepper.","United States Of America, North America",4.4,"['1/2 lb (225g) bacon (12 slices)', '8 slices white bread', '8 lettuce leaves', '8 slices of ripe tomatoes', '8 tbsp mayonnaise']",4,7min,8min,-,15min,TasteAtlas,"['Prepare the bacon first; cook it so it becomes crispy, and then place on some paper towels to drain.', 'Next, toast the bread and spread a tablespoon of mayonnaise on each slice.', 'Now, assemble the sandwiches in the following order: toast with mayonnaise side up, 1 lettuce leaf, 2 slices of tomato, 3 bacon slices, 1 lettuce leaf, toast with mayonnaise side down.

The Original Onion Rings,"Preparing onion rings may seem simple, but there is a whole set of rules to follow to make them perfectly crispy on the outside and cooked on the inside. First, large onions — preferably yellow ones — are peeled and cut crosswise into 1/4 to 1/2-inch-thick slices. Flour is mixed with salt and other optional dry ingredients such as pepper, paprika, baking powder, baking soda, cornstarch, and cornmeal. Eggs are used in most recipes, and the main liquid ingredient depends on the recipe and can include milk, buttermilk, beer, mineral water, vodka, or cream. Dry and liquid ingredients are then combined into a thick batter in which the onion rings are dipped. Alternatively, the onion rings can be dipped in flour first, then immersed in a mixture of eggs and the main liquid ingredient, and dipped in flour or breadcrumbs once again. The rings are fried shortly in deep, hot oil heated to a temperature ranging from 350 to 375˚F. Fried onion rings are drained from excess oil on paper towels, seasoned with salt, and served.","United States Of America, North America",4.3,"['6 large mild onions', '100g flour', '1/4 cup cream', 'pepper', 'salt', '3 eggs', '1/4 lb parmesan cheese', 'lard, for frying', 'melted butter with mustard, for serving']",6,15min,10min,-,25min,TasteAtlas,"['Peel the onions, remove their top and bottom, and cut them into 1/2-inch-thick slices.', 'Prepare the batter by mixing flour, cream, salt, pepper, and eggs for 10 minutes.', 'Grate the parmesan cheese finely and add it to the batter.

Original S’Mores,"An American classic and a favorite childhood treat, s’mores evoke memories of camping and long summer nights around a campfire. Made with only three ingredients — graham crackers, chocolate and marshmallows, this dessert is surprisingly easy to make. Marshmallows are roasted on sticks over hot coals or open flame, rotating until they become light brown on the outside and gooey on the inside. Alternatively, marshmallows can be baked in the oven as well. Then, a sweet sandwich is assembled in the following order — a graham cracker is topped with chocolate, which is followed by a hot marshmallow and another graham cracker. Hot marshmallows will cause the chocolate to melt, making s’mores ready for consumption. Two close relatives to s’mores are Mallomars — a graham cracker cookie topped with marshmallow and covered with chocolate, and the MoonPie — two round graham crackers with a marshmallow filling in between, also chocolate coated.","United States Of America, North America",4.1,"['8 sticks (for toasting the marshmallows)', '16 graham crackers', '8 bars plain chocolate, broken in two', '16 marshmallows']",8,3min,5min,-,8min,TasteAtlas,"['Poke two marshmallows onto each stick and toast them over coals.', 'When they become gooey and crispy, take them off the sticks.

Sauerkraut,"One of the simplest fermentation recipes out there, to make sauerkraut you need nothing more than cabbage, salt, and a container in which the fermentation will take place. The stem is removed from the head of the cabbage which is then shredded and mixed with salt. After cabbage has had time to rest, it is squeezed to extract all the liquid, then placed in a sterilized container, either a crock or a mason jar, depending on the amount of cabbage. The leftover liquid is poured over the cabbage and acts as a brining solution. The cabbage is then pressed with a heavy object, and the container is covered with a cloth and secured with rubber so that the air can circulate, but dust and insects can’t fall into it. Over the next 24 hours, the cabbage should become more and more limp and compact as time passes, so that at the end of 24 hours it is entirely covered in its liquid. If that does not happen, water needs to be added. The container should be placed in a cold, dark place to ferment. The lenght of fermentation will vary on the amount of cabbage, from a few days for smaller jars, to a few weeks in case an entire barrel of cabbage is cured. Sauerkraut is typically made with white cabbage, but any other cabbage will do. Ingredients like caraway seeds, bay leaves or peppercorns are added to the cabbage for flavor. If stored in a cold and dark place, sauerkraut can keep for months. For consumption, sauerkraut is served fresh as a side to various meats and sausages, but can also be sautéed before use.","Germany, Europe",3.8,"['1 small head green cabbage (about 3 pounds; 1.4kg), trimmed, cored, and shredded, outer leaves reserved', '28g salt, plus more as needed', '1 teaspoon (4g) caraway seeds or juniper berries (optional)']",Serving,1h,-,-,1h,TasteAtlas,"['Shred the cabbage with a knife or a mandolin.

However, if there is still not enough liquid, move to the next step.', 'Pack all the cabbage together with the liquid into a bell jar. Cover the shredded cabbage with reserved cabbage leaves and press down, so the brine comes to the top. Ideally, you should have a ½ to 1-inch layer of brine covering the cabbage.', 'Next, add weights to compress the cabbage further. In case you do not have enough brine, add plain tap water or a 2% salt solution (2 grams of salt per 100 ml of water).', 'Seal the bell jar with a lid and place in a cool, dark place.', 'After no more than three days you should be able to see bubbles forming in the liquid, which is a sign of fermentation.', 'Once a week has passed, open the jar to push the cabbage below the brining liquid, and add more water or salt solution if necessary.

Panettone,"This half-bread, half-cake is typically shaped like a dome with either a cylindrical, octagon or a frustum base and is usually 12-15 cm high. The preparation that can last even up to a few days begins with making the sourdough starter which is then kneaded with flour to make a smooth dough. A small amount of milk together with melted butter, eggs, yolks, and sugar syrup is added next, followed by candied peel and fruits like orange, lemon, and cedar that have been previously shortly soaked in water. The resulting dough is shaped into a ball and placed inside a special panettone mold which helps to keep the dough from overflowing as it bakes. Finally, a baker makes a cross engraving on top and then places the bread into the oven to bake at 200-220°C. After five minutes have passed, the remaining butter is poured on the cross, and the panettone is placed back into the oven to bake at a lower temperature until done. For serving, panettone is cut up in wedges and can be eaten at any time of the day; in the morning with a cup of coffee, as a mid-day snack, or as dolce after a meal with a glass of Marsala or Moscato d’Asti wine. It is also customary to pair panettone with hot beverages like eggnog and hot chocolate.

The said ingredients are chopped, and some are either blanched or sautéed, then wrapped in egg roll wrappers made from wheat flour, egg, water, and salt dough, although nowadays typically store-bought wrappers are used. Egg rolls can be made as small as the size of half a hot dog or as big as the size of a banana, which is a version also known as the New-York style egg roll.

Chicago-Style Deep Dish Pizza,"Unlike regular pizza dough, deep dish pizza dough is made with more oil and is not tossed but pressed into the bottom and sides of a deep pizza pan, providing a sturdy casing for the topping. A layer of sliced, not shredded, low-moisture mozzarella is placed on the bottom, followed by the traditional but not obligatory layer of raw Italian sausage. A layer of crushed, uncooked tomatoes placed on top covers the entire pizza and has the role of protecting the lower layers of pizza topping from overcooking and charring. Often, the tomato sauce is sprinkled with grated parmesan cheese and/or hard cheese. The pizza is baked for about 35 minutes and served, unlike many other pizzas, with a knife and fork.

Traditional Scottish Haggis,"One of the finest examples of traditional Scottish cuisine, haggis may not look attractive at first glance, but it compensates its looks with a rich, meaty taste which some people also describe as earthy and nutty. Basically, haggis is a savory pudding prepared with meat, oatmeal, onions, suet, salt, and pepper, and in this case, meat refers to sheep’s pluck or offal — heart, lungs, and liver. The haggis is traditionally encased in a sheep’s stomach, which is, in modern times, sometimes replaced with a synthetic sausage casing. The first step is to soak the sheep’s stomach in salted water and to turn it inside out. The heart, lungs, and liver are cooked in unsalted water for 1,5 hours or until tender, after which they are left to cool. The stock is reserved for later preparation, while the pluck is chopped, minced or grated, and mixed with onions, suet, lightly toasted oatmeal, salt, and pepper. The mixture is then stuffed into the sheep’s stomach, which is tied or sewn, pierced in a few spots, and cooked for 3 hours until it swells. Prior to serving, haggis is transferred onto a serving plate, patted dry, and cut with a sharp knife, so the delicious, crumbly filling pours out. The color of the filling can range from light brown to almost black, which depends on the proportion of the used ingredients. Traditionally, haggis is served with a side of bashed neeps and mashed tatties (turnips and potatoes), as well as a glass of Scottish whisky.","Scotland, Europe",4,"['sheep’s stomach', 'sheep’s pluck', 'salt', 'ground pepper', 'rosemary', 'sage', 'thyme', 'onion', 'oatmeal', 'suet', 'chopped parsley, for garnishing']",6,2h,3h,-,17h,TasteAtlas,"['Place sheep’s pluck in a large bowl of unsalted water.

Traditional Rheinischer Sauerbraten,"A traditional dish of German cuisine, sauerbraten is considered a quintessential fall comfort food. The preparation starts with marinating the meat — traditionally horsemeat, but nowadays most often beef, but also lamb, venison, mutton, rabbit and pork meat — anywhere from three to up to ten days. The marinade base made with red wine vinegar and wine is enriched with various spices and herbs such as peppercorns, bay leaves, mace, coriander, juniper berries, cloves, nutmeg, and many more. It will also often include vegetables like carrots, onions, and celery. After marination, the meat is pat dried and seared in oil or lard, then braised with the leftover marinade for four hours or more, until the meat is succulent and tender. The marinade is strained and thickened with roux, and/or ingredients like crushed gingerbread, lebkuchen, sour cream, and apfelkraut (apple jam).

Italian Academy Of Cuisine'S Lombardian Chiacchiere,"Crunchy, brittle and full of flavor — this, in a nutshell, is chiacchiere, an Italian deep-fried pastry most commonly prepared during carnival and other festive occasions, such as Christmas, New Year and Easter. Made with the simplest ingredients possible — flour, eggs, sugar, salt, and butter — these golden bites still manage to be packed with scents and flavors. Mostly, this can be linked to the fact that the dough is enhanced with lemon or orange zest and liqueur such as the Italian grappa brandy, white wine, rum or Marsala wine. The preparation starts by mixing flour, eggs, egg yolks, butter, salt, sugar, lemon or orange zest, and liqueur, and kneading them into a firm dough. The dough is left to rest shortly, and then it is rolled into thin sheets and cut using a fluted pastry wheel which makes distinctive zigzag edges. Sheets of dough can be cut into rectangles or rhombi, often with an additional incision or two in the middle, or into long strips which are sometimes tied into loose knots. The next step is frying, which is usually done in vegetable seed oil or olive oil. After being drained on paper towels, chiacchiere is sprinkled with icing sugar and served.","Italy, Europe",3.9,"['500 g white flour', '1 egg and 2 egg yolks', '50 g butter', 'pinch of salt', 'extra virgin olive oil', 'icing sugar']",6,15min,15min,-,30min,TasteAtlas,"['Knead the dough with flour, eggs, egg yolks, butter and a pinch of salt.', 'Roll out the dough into thin sheets and cut into squares or rhombi using a fluted pastry wheel, making another incision in the middle.

Cassata Siciliana,"Even though it probably originated as a simple egg, sugar, and ricotta cheesecake, today’s cassata is a complex cake made with liqueur-soaked sponge cake layered with sweetened ricotta cheese which is typically studded with candied fruit, various jellies, and sometimes even chocolate. Unlike its frozen store-bought counterpart, which is filled with ice cream, genuine Italian cassata is always filled with fresh cheese and served chilled. The filling can be flavored with various sweet liqueurs, while the base for cassata consists of pan di Spagna, a kind of Genoise sponge cake, which can either be prepared a few days in advance or bought ready-made. Cassata is traditionally sugar-glazed and lavishly decorated with candied fruit, Baroque sugar icing garnishes, flourishes of marzipan fruit, rosettes, flowers, and curlicues.","Sicily, Italy",5,"['1 pan di Spagna sponge (about 400g/14 oz)', '200g (7 oz) ground almonds', '200g (7 oz) sugar', 'green food coloring for cakes, as desired', '1 cup (240 ml) of white Vermouth', '500g (1.1 lbs) fresh ricotta', '350g (12.3 oz) sugar', '1 sachet of vanilla', '70g (2.5 oz) dark chocolate, diced', '50g (1.75 oz) zuccata (candied pumpkin)', '100 ml (1/3 cup + 1 tbsp + 1 tsp) water', '250g (8.8 oz) powdered sugar', 'orange flower water', 'syrup', '240 ml (1 cup) Vermouth', '240 ml (1 cup) water', 'icing, to glaze', '300 - 400g (10.5 - 14 oz) candied fruit']",8,1h 30min,10min,5h,6h 40min,TasteAtlas,"['Start the preparations ahead of time.

Classic Fènglísū Cake,"Made from buttery shortbread-like pastry and a pineapple filling, fènglísū is a delicate bite-sized cake, usually in the shape of a short cylinder or rectangle. The filling is prepared first by chopping the pineapple into very small pieces and cooking it over medium heat with some sugar and maltose syrup until all the liquid evaporates and the pineapple reaches a thick, sticky consistency. Next, the dough is prepared by mixing butter with sugar and egg and adding flour, salt, and condensed milk. After cooling in the refrigerator, the dough is divided into pieces. Each piece is rolled out, filled with pineapple jam and assembled into an individual portion. Baking is done in a 170˚C oven, and the cakes are turned over mid-baking, so they are equally baked on both sides. After cooling, the cakes are ready to be served, or they can be stored in air-tight containers to preserve their freshness. Fènglísū is a popular gift for special occasions, including New Year’s celebrations, weddings and engagement rituals — they are often distributed with wedding invitations, or as a thank-you gift after the ceremony. Additionally, fènglísū is a best-selling Taiwanese souvenir, especially among the Asian tourists, who can choose among numerous industrial or artisanal brands, often in beautiful gift boxes. Fènglísū is also popular in Singapore and Malaysia, where the filling is based on a winter melon flavored with pineapple essence, while the original Taiwanese version insists on fresh pineapple.","Taiwan, Asia",4.3,"['1 pineapple (750 g)', '80 g caster sugar', '50 g maltose syrup', '125 g cake flour', '125 g butter', '20 g caster sugar', '1/2 beaten egg (25 g)', '25 g powdered milk', 'pinch of salt']",5,1h,35min,-,1h 35min,TasteAtlas,"['First, clean the pineapple and chop it into very small pieces.', 'Place the pineapple and caster sugar in a large skillet and cook over high heat, until the sugar dissolves.

Classic Veroian Revani,"Simple in appearance but bursting with textures and flavors, revani is a Greek cake which belongs to the siropiasta group of desserts. Just like other sweets from this family, such as baklava, portokalopita, melomakarona, kataifi, samali, and others, its main characteristic is that it is soaked in sugar syrup, which makes it moist and juicy. The preparation of revani begins with mixing the dry ingredients — flour, semolina, baking powder, salt, and sugar — with the wet ones which include eggs, yogurt or milk, and sometimes fat (butter or olive oil). In some recipes, the egg whites are mixed with sugar into a meringue which gives revani a spongy texture. Furthermore, to help achieve revani's typical, grainy texture, semolina can be replaced with ground almonds or flaked or desiccated coconut. The batter is poured into a baking pan and baked in a pre-heated oven for 20 to 40 minutes at 170 to 180˚C. After that, revani is drizzled with a sugar syrup which can be flavored with lemon or orange juice or zest. Revani can be consumed at room temperature, or chilled from the refrigerator.

Yemeni Martabak,"Crispy on the outside and richly stuffed on the inside, martabak is one of the most popular street food dishes across the Western and South-Eastern Asia. Even though it seems simple at first glance, its preparation — if done traditionally — requires some serious skill. When it comes to savory martabak, the first step is to knead flour, salt, water, oil or ghee, and sometimes eggs, into a soft dough. After resting for a while wrapped in plastic foil or soaked in oil, the dough is divided into individual portions which will be turned into thin, roti-like pancakes. Traditionally, small balls of dough are pressed into flat discs and then tossed in the air until they become very thin and almost transparent. Martabak street vendors tend to turn this process into a show for the passers-by, while an at-home preparation suggests merely rolling the dough with a rolling pin. The filling is prepared by mixing sautéed ingredients — usually, onions, garlic, shallots, and minced meat — with the fresh ones, which can include tomato, fresh herbs such as mint and coriander, whisked eggs, and cheese. The filling is spread into the center of the pancake, which is then folded into a rectangular envelope, and carefully transferred onto an oiled griddle or a frying pan. Martabak is cooked on both sides until browned, while the degree of crispiness is a matter of personal preference. Hot martabak is cut into small portions and served with some lemon or lime wedges or dipping sauce. Sweet martabak or martabak manis is particularly popular in Indonesia, and its preparation method is slightly different. The dough is in fact a thick, pancake-like batter made with yeast, which is cooked on one side only. The top is smeared with butter, ghee, peanuts, chocolate, condensed milk, and even cheese, after which the pancake is folded, cut, and served.","Yemen, Asia",4.1,"['3 cups bread flour', '3/4 cup water', '1/3 cup oil', '1 1/4 tsp salt', '1 egg', 'extra oil', '½ onion', '1 clove garlic', '½ lb ground meat', '½ tomato', '1 pinch spices (cumin, coriander, ground black pepper, ground red chili powder)', '1 cup leek or green onion', '4 eggs', '½ tsp salt', '2-3 tbsp white cheese, optional']",6,30min,45min,-,1h 15min,TasteAtlas,"['First, make the dough.

"Adams ""Original"" Red Velvet Cake","The red velvet cake became the pinnacle of festive desserts in America thanks to its vibrant red color, subtle yet tangy chocolate flavor, and a refreshing French-style ermine icing. The sponge is prepared by first creaming the sugar, eggs, and shortening, to which a paste out of cocoa and food dye is added. Subsequently, salt, flour, buttermilk, and vanilla are added to the mix, alongside soda-induced vinegar. Finally, the batter is poured into several cake pans (3 or 4) and baked. Although the ermine frosting takes a bit of time to prepare, it gives the cake its authentic taste and creaminess. The ermine frosting is made by slowly adding milk to the flour and then cooking it until thickens, stirring the mixture throughout. Sugar, vanilla, and buttercream are added to the cooked mixture that is then beaten until it starts to resemble whipped cream.

Bread Pudding With Whiskey Sauce In New Orleans Style,"Although the basic ingredients are quite ordinary — bread, milk, eggs, and sugar — bread pudding is a dish which can range from simple to extravagant, depending on your inspiration. The preparation starts with some stale white bread, cut into cubes or torn into small pieces. The bread should be dry — either use some leftovers from the previous day or lightly toast the bread cubes in the oven. Milk, eggs, and sugar are mixed in a large bowl, often accompanied with butter, heavy cream, cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla extract, dried fruits, and nuts. This custard-like mixture is poured over the bread cubes and left to soak at room temperature, after which the bread pudding mixture is transferred into a baking dish and baked in the oven.

Bûche De Noël,"The quintessential French Christmas dessert, bûche de Noël, can be as simple or as lavish as one would like it to be, adorned with garnishes and elaborative designs or kept as a simple roulade. In general, it is a sweet roulade consisting of a génoise sponge that's spread traditionally with chocolate buttercream and rolled into a cylinder that is then iced with the same buttercream and made to resemble a bark by running a fork through the icing. Still, to mimic the appearance of a log, the ends of the cylinder can be cut off before frosting, and attached to its top or the sides. Also, instead of chocolate buttercream, differently flavored creams or jams can be used instead. As far as decoration, it can consist of just a sprinkling of powdered sugar, which is intended to resemble snow. Meringue mushrooms are also a quite common decorative element, as are various berries, chocolate shavings, ornaments made from fondant, and many others. Often, real branches or decorations from nature are used to further accentuate the forest feel.","Paris, France",5,"['3 large egg whites, at room temperature', '1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar', '1 cup (125g) confectioners’ sugar', '1/2 cup (100g) Dutch-processed cocoa powder', '1 1/4 cups (300 ml) water', '2/3 cup (135g) sugar', '2 1/2 tbsp Grand Marnier or other liqueur', '4 tbsp sugar', '1 tbsp cornstarch', '2 large egg yolks, at room temperature', '1 cup (240 ml) whole milk', '1/2 vanilla bean, split in half lengthwise', '3 1/2 oz (100g) semisweet chocolate', '3 large egg yolks, at room temperature', '1 large whole egg, at room temperature', 'scant 1 cup (200g) sugar', '1/3 cup (80 ml) water', '1 1/2 cups (3 sticks) (340g) plus 1 tbsp unsalted butter, at room temperature, cubed', 'pure coffee extract, to taste', '2 large eggs, at room temperature', '2 large egg yolks, at room temperature', '1/3 cup (65g) plus 2 tbsp granulated sugar', '1 1/2 tsp whole milk', '2 large egg whites, at room temperature', '1/3 cup (40g) cake flour', '1/4 cup (30g) confectioners’ sugar']",16,1h 30min,1h 40min,10h,13h 10min,TasteAtlas,"['Set the oven to preheat to 275°F/140°C and cover the bottom of a rimmed baking pan with greaseproof paper.', ""Whisk the egg whites with a mixer on medium speed until frothy, then, with the mixer running, start adding sugar, tablespoon by tablespoon.

Cassoulet Languedocien,"A simple peasant fare, cassoulet, is a dish that requires very little technique and skill to prepare but does require time and patience. First, the beans which have been soaking overnight are shortly boiled the following day, then drained and set aside for later. Pork bones, chicken, pork rinds, onions, and carrots are cooked in water and then filtered to get a clear broth, while pork rinds are kept for later use. Next, the beans are added to the broth and cooked for an hour until they are soft, but not falling apart. Meanwhile, the duck confit is seared in a pan, and the Toulouse sausage and pieces of pork meat are then fried in the leftover fat. Once the beans have been cooked, they are drained and combined with garlic and lard. The prepared ingredients are then arranged in an earthenware dish and poured over with the broth. The casserole is cooked for two to three hours and is occasionally drizzled with the leftover broth to prevent it from drying out.

Authentic Curtido,"A relative of German sauerkraut and Korean kimchi, curtido is a colorful mixture of cabbage, onions, and carrots fermented in a salt-and-vinegar brine. Although the preparation of this Salvadorean dish does not require special culinary skills, it does demand some patience. First, the vegetables are cut into thin strips — the cabbage, carrots, and onion play the main role, while whether or not cauliflower, broccoli, and jalapeño peppers are included depends on the recipe. The vegetables are then salted and/or submerged in some hot water briefly, just to soften a bit. Then, the mixture is placed in glass jars with seasonings, which include apple cider or pineapple vinegar, oregano, and, optionally, bay leaves, cilantro, and pepper flakes. A heavy object is placed on top to press the vegetables, which are then left to ferment for at least a few hours and up to 8 days at room temperature. The fermentation releases Lactobacillus bacteria, which have proven health benefits.

Almond Financiers From Larousse Gastronomique,"Financiers are small French cakes traditionally baked in rectangular or round molds. The traditional version is based on ground almonds, melted butter, and whipped egg whites, though most contemporary versions opt for brown butter to impart the cakes with a nutty flavor. The perfect financier will have a springy texture, golden and crispy edges, while the center will remain moist and tender. The preparation is simple but involves certain finesse. It starts with a mixture of dry ingredients — consisting of caster or powdered sugar, ground almonds, and flour — which is whisked with egg whites and butter. The batter is then piped or poured into well-greased molds or tins. When baked, financiers should rise to form a slightly dome-like shape. The classic financier is plain, but the base offers impressive room for adaptation, whether in flavorings or toppings. The most common additions include fresh fruits that are neatly pressed in the batter or slivered nuts sprinkled on top of the cakes. It is also not unusual to toy with the base, and instead of almonds, use other types of ground nuts, such as hazelnuts or even pistachios. Although these elegant almond cakes were often left out from the canonical French recipe books, they have remained a mainstay in French patisseries. They can be enjoyed as a sweet breakfast or as an excellent afternoon pick-me-up.","France, Europe",4.4,"['100g (2/3 cup + 4 tsp) all-purpose flour', '100g (1 cup) ground almonds', '300g (1 ⅓ cups) caster sugar', '8 egg whites', '2-3 tbsp vanilla sugar', '150 g (2/3 cup) unsalted butter', 'pinch of salt', 'plus a little extra butter to coat the molds']",16,10min,20min,-,2h 30min,TasteAtlas,"['Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F).', 'Generously butter the financier molds.', 'Cut the butter into pieces and melt it in a saucepan.', 'In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, ground almonds, and both types of sugar.

Basic Chiffon Cake,"Marketed under an intriguing slogan ""the first really new cake in a hundred years"", chiffon cake is somewhere between a butter cake and a sponge cake. Like the butter cake, it contains fat, but its airlight texture is achieved by gently adding whipped egg whites, the procedure was borrowed from the sponge cake recipe. The secret? Instead of butter, margarine or lard, commonly used in butter cakes, chiffon cake uses vegetable oil. The procedure is simple: dry ingredients — flour, sugar, baking powder and salt — are sifted and combined, which is followed by adding the wet ingredients — water, vegetable oil, vanilla extract, egg yolks and, optionally, grated lemon zest. All the ingredients are then mixed until the batter is completely smooth. Egg whites and cream of tartar are whipped or mixed in another bowl until stiff peaks are formed, and then the two mixtures are gently combined, so they retain an airy texture. Depending on the recipe, additional ingredients such as spices, fruit, fruit juice and chocolate can be added to the batter. Chiffon cake is most commonly baked in a tube pan or an oblong bread pan, and it is usually sprinkled with powdered sugar or covered with glaze before serving.","California, United States Of America",4.2,"['2 1/4 cups flour', '1 1/2 cups sugar', '3 tsp baking powder', '1 tsp salt', '1/2 cup vegetable oil', '5 medium-sized egg yolks, unbeaten', '3/4 cup cold water', '2 tsp vanilla', 'grated rind 1 lemon (optional)', '7-8 egg whites', '1/2 tsp cream of tartar']",16,10min,1h 10min,-,1h 20min,TasteAtlas,"['Sift the dry ingredients – flour, sugar, baking powder and salt – into a mixing bowl, and make a well in the center.', 'One by one, add the wet ingredients – oil, egg yolks, water, vanilla and lemon rind.

The main difference is that surόwki are made with only raw fruit and vegetables, while sałatki can include cooked ingredients such as eggs, meat, and seafood.","Poland, Europe",4.3,"['500 g sauerkraut', '2 sweet apples', '2 carrots', '1 onion', '50 ml olive oil', '150 ml apple or carrot juice (optional)', 'ground black pepper', '1 tbsp sugar, honey or sweetener']",6,10min,-,-,10min,TasteAtlas,"['Chop the sauerkraut into small pieces.

Italian Academy Of Cuisine'S Minestrone,"Some basic skills with a knife, seasonal vegetables, and a large pot — these three things are all you need for preparing minestrone, a hearty, rich and nutritious Italian soup. In fact, minestrone is often viewed as a legitimate option for lunch or dinner, especially when paired with some quality Italian bread and a glass of wine. The beauty of minestrone lies in the fact that it does not have a set list of ingredients — it changes depending on the season. Still, most recipes do include onions, carrots, celery, tomatoes and legumes, such as beans or peas. The process starts with chopping the vegetables into pieces of similar size, usually into cubes. The next step is to choose one of the two available techniques. One is a crudo, which is tossing the raw vegetables into the water, then gently simmering them until they are fully cooked. The other is col soffritto, meaning the vegetables — and optionally bacon — will first be sautéed with some olive oil, lard or butter, and then boiled in water or stock. Legumes, such as peas and beans, can be used fresh, especially during spring and summer. If dried legumes are used, they need to be soaked in water before cooking, preferably overnight. Herbs and more delicate vegetables, such as zucchini, can be added later during cooking so they do not fall apart. The dense texture of the minestrone is achieved thanks to the ingredients rich in starch, such as potatoes, beans, rice or pasta. Usually, minestrone is cooked on low to medium heat for 40 to 50 minutes and is finished when all the vegetables become tender, but not overcooked. Rice is added 20 minutes before the end of cooking, while small pasta varieties are ready in 5 to 10 minutes, depending on their shape and size. Garnished with a drizzle of olive oil and a handful of grated Parmesan cheese, a bowl of minestrone is ready to be served.","Italy, Europe",4.3,"['50g (1.75 oz) ground lard', '1 celery stick', '2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil', '1 onion, medium', '100g (3.5 oz) beans', '100g (3.5 oz) fresh maize', '100g (3.5 oz) wheat', '2 potatoes', '200g (7 oz) peeled tomatoes', 'salt and pepper, to taste']",4,10min,40min,-,50min,TasteAtlas,"['Place onion, chopped celery, ground lard and olive oil into a pan.', 'Add 240 ml (2 cups) of hot water.

Banana Split,"The classic banana split consists of a lengthwise-cut banana, one scoop of vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry ice cream each, chocolate, strawberry and pineapple syrup, whipped cream, nuts such as peanuts, and maraschino cherries. The banana is first peeled and split lengthways then placed in a long dish called a boat. Ice cream scoops are placed in between the two banana slices, and the syrups are drizzled over. The whole thing is topped with whipped cream, then sprinkled with peanuts, and maraschino cherries with a stem attached are placed on top.

Dresdner Stollen,"Traditionally prepared for Christmas, this German sweet bread is made with yeasted dough that’s rich in butter and eggs, and is studded with sultanas, currants, chopped almonds, and candied fruits and peels, typically lemon and orange ones. Dried apricots and marzipan paste are also often included, and the dried fruits can be spiked with rum. The dough is usually flavored with lemon zest, but spices such as cinnamon, cardamom, and anise may also be included. The dough is shaped by hand into a loaf that is brushed with butter and dusted with sugar before baking at a moderate temperature. Once baked, the still hot stollen is brushed with butter and dusted generously with powdered sugar. This step can be repeated more than once, though royal icing can also be used instead. Depending on the used ingredients, there are different kinds of stollen. For example, mandelstollen will have at least 20 percent of almonds, and marzipanstollen will have a filling of marzipan paste in the middle, while mohnstollen has a filling made with ground poppy seeds. If the dough has 40% of butter it is named butterstollen, and in case quark is added the dough, we’re talking of quarkstollen. Ideally, stollen should be made a few weeks in advance, so the flavors have time to mellow and mingle. When ready to serve, it is cut into slices and can be paired with butter, jam, and honey.","Saxony, Germany",4.1,"['1 ½ cups raisins', '1 cup chopped citron', '1 cup chopped candied orange peel', '1/2 cup rum', '2 envelopes of dry powdered yeast', '1/2 cup lukewarm water', '1 tbsp sugar, optional', '2 cups milk', '1 cup sugar', '2 tsp salt', '1 ⅓ cups butter', 'grated rind of one lemon', '2 tbsp rum', '2 cups flour', '4 eggs, lightly beaten', '5-7 cups flour', '6-8 slivered blanched almonds, or 1 tsp almond extract', '1 ½ cups chopped blanched almonds', 'melted butter', 'granulated sugar', ""confectioners' sugar, preferably vanilla-flavored""]",12,45min,55min,-,1h 40min,TasteAtlas,"['First, soak raisins, citron, and candied orange peel in rum for an hour, then drain them and reserve the rum.

Larousse Gastronommique'S Basic Consommé,"Patience is the key element in making consommé — this clear soup can be cooked for up to 5 hours, and some observation is required to get the perfect result. The preparation starts with placing a piece of fresh meat, chicken, fish, or game into a large cooking pot filled with water or stock. Additionally, marrow bones can also be used for a richer taste. Various vegetables, such as onions, carrots, leeks, parsley, and garlic are added, along with egg whites whose role is to help gather all the impurities on the surface. After bringing all the ingredients to a boil, the consommé is slowly simmered for 2 to up to 5 hours, depending on if it is prepared with pre-made stock or just water. Stirring is forbidden during this process, but the surface should be skimmed every now and then. When the cooking is finished, the consommé is strained through a dense sieve or a cloth. The final result is a crystal-clear soup packed with flavors, which is usually served at the beginning of a meal, or used as a basis for other soups and dishes. Due to its high gelatin content, a traditional consommé will turn into a gel when cooled, hence it is a basic ingredient for various aspics.","France, Europe",4,"['2 kg (4.4 lbs) lean beef', '1 ½ beef knuckle with bone', '7 L (7 qt) cold water', '35g (2 tbsp + 1 tsp) coarse salt', '3-4 big carrots', '2-3 turnips', '1 parsnip', '3-4 leeks, tied in a bundle', '2 stalks celery', '1 medium onion with 1-2 cloves stuck in it', '1 clove garlic', '1 sprig thyme', '1/4 bay leaf (optional)']",12,20min,5h,-,5h 20min,TasteAtlas,"['Take a long piece of kitchen twine and tie meat and bones.

Hot Cross Buns,"In the United Kingdom, hot cross buns are most commonly consumed during Lent and are a must on Good Friday, when they are prepared and eaten on the same day, as the mark of the end of Lent. The buns are made with an enriched, sweet, and yeasted dough that is studded with raisins and/or currants, and spiced with the so-called mixed spice, typically a combo of cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice. In the past, the cross on the buns was made with a knife, but today, the cross is made with either shortcrust pastry or a mix of flour and water. Crosses made with sugar icing are also quite common in recipes today. Once the cross is applied, the buns are baked and then brushed with, traditionally, a sugar syrup glaze. But, honey glaze or apricot jam are often used for the same purpose. Typically, hot cross buns are eaten toasted, slathered with a generous amount of butter, and served with a cup of tea.","England, Europe",4.1,"['4 cups (480g) bread (strong) flour', 'a pinch of salt', '2 tsp mixed spice', '6 tbsp butter', '2 tsp (1 packet) active dry yeast', '1/4 cup (50g) sugar', '1 egg', '1 cup (240 ml) warm milk (30 seconds in the microwave will do)', '1 cup (160g) dried seedless raisins', '50g (1.75 oz) mixed peel, optional', 'grated zest of 1 orange, to taste, optional', '1 cup (120g) flour', '3 tbsp cold water', '1 tbsp boiling water', '1 tbsp sugar']",10,45min,25min,30min,1h 40min,TasteAtlas,"['Add the flour, the salt, and the mixed spice to a large bowl.

Classic Aşure,"There is no such thing as a set recipe for aşure — the number of ingredients can range between seven to around 15, while some sources cite that this number can reach up to 40 ingredients. The preparation starts with soaking the grains and the beans overnight, preferably in separate bowls. The grains are usually wheat, barley, and bulgur, while the beans include white kidney beans, haricot beans, fava beans, and chickpeas. Next, the beans and the grains are cooked separately until softened, after which they are joined in one large bowl and simmered over low heat. Rice, sugar, rehydrated dried fruit, nuts, and flavorings such as orange or lemon zest and rosewater are added during cooking. After the desired consistency is reached — and it can range from liquid to dense, depending on personal preference — aşure is left to cool.

Classic Quẩy,"Although it looks simple, this dish is surprisingly tricky to make, mainly because of the lengthy dough resting process and a lot of manual work. Following the recipe is essential, especially when resting the dough. The process starts with mixing the leavening agents — either baking powder and baking soda, or baking soda and baking ammonia — with water, each in their own bowl. The mixtures are then joined with flour, salt, sugar, and water, kneaded briefly, and the dough is left to rest for 20 minutes under a damp cloth or covered with a plastic wrap. The process of kneading and resting is repeated for 3 times overall, after which the dough is rolled out into a flat disc and left to rest for another 2,5 to 4 hours. The dough is then rolled out for one last time, so it is around 1/2 cm thick, and cut into small rectangles. A shallow dent is made on half of these rectangles using a bamboo stick or a chopstick moistened with water. The remaining half of the rectangles are placed on top of the dented ones, so they resemble a sandwich, and finally, another dent is made on top. The joined rectangles are stretched and tossed in hot oil. During frying, quẩy will expand and separate slightly. When they start floating on the surface of the oil and develop a golden brown crust, they should be removed from the oil, drained and served. A well-prepared quẩy should be crispy on the outside and hollow on the inside. In Vietnam, quẩy is most commonly paired with rice porridge (chao ga), soy milk, and pho broth, especially in northern parts of the country.","Vietnam, Asia",4.3,"['500 g all-purpose flour', '1 tsp salt', '1 tbsp sugar', '250-300 ml water', '5 g baking powder', '10 g baking soda', 'oil, for frying']",12,5h 30min,20min,-,5h 50min,TasteAtlas,"['Place baking powder and baking soda in two separate bowls.

Classic Kapsalon,"Filling, practical, and influenced by various national cuisines, kapsalon is a perfect example of how culinary traditions from different sides of the world can create a favorite meal. This dish undoubtedly qualifies as fast food, and one portion contains roughly 1800 calories. The preparation of kapsalon starts with preparing potato fries — frieten (Flemish) or patat (Dutch) — which can be deep-fried, oven-baked or made in a fryer. The fries are lightly salted and arranged on the bottom of a disposable metal food container. Then, a portion of shawarma meat is layered on top of the fries. Shawarma is a Middle-Eastern specialty usually made with spiced lamb meat, although the Dutch version rather uses beef, veal, chicken, and even pork. Typically, shawarma is grilled on vertical rotating metal skewers. However, for homemade preparation, it is suggested to cook the meat in a skillet. Next comes the cheese, preferably real Dutch Gouda cheese with a high fat-content, which should be sprinkled over the fries and meat, and baked shortly in the oven, so it melts. To finish, fresh vegetables, such as lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and onion, are scattered on top and the whole thing is drizzled with sauce, either knoflooksaus (garlic sauce) or sambal, a spicy Indonesian sauce. Most Dutch fast food shops sell kapsalon for a reasonable price and offer vegetarian or light varieties made with falafel, fish, or chicken.","Rotterdam, Netherlands",3.2,"['700g (1.5 lbs) potatoes', '500g (1.1 lbs) shawarma meat', '100g (3.5 oz) grated Gouda cheese (mature, 48+)', '1/2 cucumber', '2 tomatoes', '100g (3.5 oz) iceberg lettuce', '100 ml (1/3 cup + 1 tbsp + 1 tsp) garlic sauce', 'sambal sauce, to taste']",4,15min,30min,-,45min,TasteAtlas,"['Peel the potatoes, cut them into fries, and place them on a baking dish lined with parchment.

Dorayaki,"Traditional, yet simple, dorayaki is perfect as an afternoon snack, usually enjoyed with a cup of Japanese green tea. It is made up of two sweet and fluffy pancake slices that enclose a red bean filling. The preparation begins with making the batter. Eggs are first whisked with sugar, and then flour with baking soda and milk with honey are added in batches. Often, mirin and soy sauce are also added. Portions of batter are dropped onto a heated non-stick pan and cooked until the surface appears bubbly at which point the pancakes are flipped and cooked for no more than a minute.

Classic Fried Okra,"Nicknamed “the southern popcorn”, fried okra is a simple side dish which can also be served as an appetizer, especially when paired with various sauces or dips. The preparation is simple and rather quick. First, you will need to choose fresh okra pods, preferably under 3-4 inches in length, since smaller okra pods tend to be softer and less chewy than the larger ones.

Classic Chakalaka,"Spicy, colorful, versatile and easy to prepare, chakalaka is a vegetarian South African dish which can fit into many categories — it can be a salsa, a relish, a condiment, or a main dish, depending on what it is paired with. Most commonly, chakalaka is prepared by sautéing finely chopped root vegetables such as onions, garlic, and carrots with spices like curry powder or leaf masala, after which the bell peppers, fresh tomatoes or tomato sauce, baked beans and seasonings are added. Other additions may include ginger, chilis, cauliflowers, shredded cabbage or anything else you may have at hand. This dish is as tasty hot as it is cold, because, like many other relishes, it develops its full flavor through time. Very often, chakalaka is garnished with some chopped fresh coriander, which gives a note of freshness to the dish. Chakalaka is most commonly served at South African barbecues called braais paired with grilled meat and sausages. Otherwise, it can be paired with bread, maize porridge mieliepap, roughly chopped corn kernel porridge pap, curries and various stews. As for its texture, it can vary from salad-like to soup-like, depending on the amount of tomato sauce used. Ready in under half an hour and tasty for days if refrigerated and jarred, chakalaka is a perfect choice for long, hot summer days.","South Africa, Africa",4.1,"['6 large tomatoes', '2 large onions', '2 green peppers', '250g (8.8 oz) grated carrots', '3 tbsp oil', '1-2 chilies', '1 tbsp minced garlic', '1 tbsp grated ginger', '2 tbsp leaf masala or curry powder', '1 tin (410g/14.1 oz) baked beans', 'salt to taste', 'pepper to taste', '100g (3.5 oz) chopped fresh coriander']",6,10min,15min,-,25min,TasteAtlas,"['To begin, prepare the vegetables.

Navajo Frybread,"This staple Native American dish is traditionally made with only five ingredients — flour, baking powder, powdered milk, salt, and water are mixed together and kneaded into a smooth, soft dough, which is then divided into small fist- or egg-sized balls. These dough balls are then patted or stretched by hand into disks, usually only 1/4 to 1/2-inch (0.6 to 1.25 cm) thick. They are then shallow-fried or deep-fried until golden on both sides and are then placed on paper towels to drain. An important step is to leave the dough to rest for at least 20 to 30 minutes, either before or after it has been divided into balls. The longer the rest, the better — this will give the frybread a light and fluffy texture. The liquid ingredients are typically added to the dry ones, but some recipes do the opposite. In addition to this basic recipe, oil or lard is also often added, and milk and yeast are sometimes used instead of water and baking powder. Eggs, yogurt, buttermilk, and cornmeal also make frequent appearances in frybread recipes. Frybread is often sweetened by adding pieces of pumpkin, sugar, and spices. It is eaten hot on its own, as a side, or with savory or sweet toppings such as jam, powdered sugar and cinnamon, honey, and butter. Frybread is also used in a Native American taco-style dish in place of a tortilla to hold usual taco toppings like ground beef, salsa, and grated cheese.","South Dakota, United States Of America",3.5,"['1 cup (120g) flour', '1 tsp baking powder', '1/4 cup (60g) powdered milk', '1/4 tsp salt', 'warm water, as needed']",4,20min,15min,1h,1h 35min,TasteAtlas,"['In a bowl, mix all the dry ingredients and slowly add warm water, kneading until you form a dough.', 'Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead until you get a smooth, non-sticky dough.

Ayva Tatlisi,"Ayva tatlısı is a winter dessert from Turkey prepared by poaching quinces in sugar and water.

Śledzie W Oleju (Herrings In Oil),"Served on Christmas Eve, during Lent, as a party appetizer or a side dish, Polish śledzie is a versatile dish made with salted herrings pickled in vinegar, oil, sour cream, onion, apples, and spices. Its preparation begins with pre-salted herrings which can be purchased whole (with skin and bones) or filleted. To remove excess salt and pungent smell, the herrings are soaked in cold water for a few hours or overnight, after which they are marinated or pickled. Oil and vinegar are the most traditional options, and they are usually combined with peppercorns, bay leaves, and allspice. However, the pickle can also include a variety of other ingredients such as apples, onions, tomatoes, cucumbers, mushrooms, raisins, prunes, etc. which sometimes leads to crossing the blurry line towards sałatka and surówka — popular Polish salads which can include śledzie. While most śledzie recipes include marinades made with raw ingredients, there is a local variety from northern Poland, namely the Pomeranian area, which places the herring in a marinade made with sautéed onions, tomato, sugar, and spices. This type of dish is known as śledzie po Kaszubsku (Kashubian herrings), and its name was derived from the Kashubians, an ethnic group who inhabited northern Poland before the Slavic arrival. Śledzie from the city of Szczecin in the northern Polish region of West Pomerania was included in the List of Traditional Products of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.","Poland, Europe",4.1,"['8 salted herring fillets', '1 large onion, sliced', '1/2 cup olive or sunflower oil', '3 allspice seeds', '3 peppercorns', '1 bay leaf']",6,1h,-,-,1h,TasteAtlas,"['Place herring fillets in a bowl of cold water and soak them for one hour.

Ricciarelli Di Siena,"At its basic, the traditional ricciarelli di Siena cookies are made with almonds, egg whites, and sugar. The resulting dough is shaped into lozenges, which are typically placed on a host wafer or rice paper, but that's not a must. A generous dusting of powdered sugar completes the picture, after which the cookies are left to dry — a key step that ensures that cookies end up with a cracked surface once baked. Most common variations include the addition of flavorings such as orange and lemon peel or candied peel. Also, regular almonds can be partially replaced with bitter almonds, while the almond extract is often added to the dough for a more pronounced almond flavor. Usually, sugar syrup is added to the dough, as well as raising agents and flour.

Fudge,"Fudge is a soft, creamy candy made with sugar, butter, and milk, which are heated and cooked until soft ball stage (from 112 to 116°C/234 to 240°F). The blend is then removed from the stove and, once chilled a bit, beaten to acquire smooth consistency. Next, the mixture is poured into a pan and left to cool completely before cutting. Marshmallow cream or sweetened condensed milk are frequently incorporated into the batter to speed up the preparation process since they reduce the amount of beating required when assembling the treat. Fudge is a crystalline candy. The key to making a successful batch is controlling the crystallization of the supersaturated sugar solution. Miniature crystals of sugar are responsible for its solid but creamy consistency. There are many variations on the basic recipe, mostly in the form of using supplementary ingredients, such as chocolate, caramel, fruits, nuts, and candies. The Americans love their fudge with the addition of peanut butter, whereas the Brits enjoy the dessert supplemented with clotted cream or rum and raisins. Penuche is a brown sugar variety commonly associated with the American South and New England, whereas versions of the dessert also appear in Scotland and England's Midlands region. Fudge is usually served cut into squares.","Baltimore, United States Of America",3.9,"['4 oz (120g) chocolate', '2 cups (400g) sugar', '1 tsp vanilla', '1/2 cup (120 ml) milk', '1 tbsp butter, heaping']",16,10min,10min,4h,4h 20min,TasteAtlas,"['Melt the sugar, chocolate, milk and butter in a saucepan over heat.

Academia Barilla'S Grissini,"Long and thin, these Italian breadsticks are not only a great nibble before any meal but are also visually attractive — to turn into a table centerpiece, they require only to be placed in a large glass or a vase. Hand-rolled, and easily recognized by their knotted surface, robatà breadsticks, also known as rustica, are the older and more traditional varietal of grissini that varies in length from 40 to 80 cm. Stirà ones, however, are made by hand pulling a piece of dough to arm’s length which makes for an even crispier grissini. Either lard or olive oil is added to the dough made with flour, water, salt, and sugar, but for those calorie-conscious grissini can also be prepared with water only. The dough is typically twice proved, then cut up into strips that are either rolled or stretched to the desired length. The grissini are then arranged on a semolina-dusted baking tray and baked until golden and crisp, but the rule is that, although baked grissini should have a crunchy texture the insides should retain a bit of chewiness. To add variety to the basic recipe, one can add ingredients like tomatoes, caramelized onions, herbs, and olives to the dough or sprinkle various seeds over the prepared dough sticks before baking. Grissini makes for a great appetizer, typically wrapped in ham and other cold cuts or paired with different cheeses, and alternatively, can also be served as a side to soups or stews.","Turin, Italy",4.6,"['1 ½ lb wheat flour', '¼ cup extra virgin olive oil', '½ oz salt', '¾ oz fresh yeast', '1 2/3 cups water', 'durum wheat flour to taste']",6,1h,15min,-,1h 15min,TasteAtlas,"['Mound the flour on the working surface, make a small well in the middle of it and add to it, olive oil, salt, yeast, and water.

Basic Rahat Lokum,"One of the hallmarks of Turkish cuisine, rahat lokum — also known as lokum or Turkish delight — is a delicate, jelly-like dessert which comes in a variety of colors and flavors. It is usually shaped into bite-sized cubes, although it can be rolled and cut into slices, or shaped into small balls. Typically, rahat lokum is prepared by combining cornstarch, water, sugar, and lemon juice in a cooking pot and bringing them to a boil, after which the heat is reduced to low, and the mixture is stirred constantly until it thickens. Then, the lokum mixture is removed from heat and enriched with flavorings, food colorings, and additions. Flavorings typically include rose water, orange blossom water or fruit juice and are mandatory. On the other hand, using food coloring and additional ingredients such as nuts and fruit is completely optional. The rahat lokum mixture is poured into a baking pan lined with plastic wrap and left to thicken completely. Finally, it is cut and rolled into a mixture of cornstarch and powdered sugar, desiccated coconut, or ground or chopped nuts. Although it is quite sweet, it is believed that a good lokum can be recognized by the fact that it will not make you thirsty. The fact that it comes in thousands of variants guarantees that everyone can find a kind that suits their taste perfectly.","Istanbul, Turkiye",4.3,"['25 g icing sugar', '100 g cornstarch (divided: 25 g + 75 g)', '700 g caster sugar', 'juice of 1 lemon', '500 ml water (divided: 400 ml + 100 ml)', '3 tbsp powdered gelatin', 'red or pink coloring, optional', '2 tbsp rose water']",12,15min,25min,-,40min,TasteAtlas,"['Start by lining an 8x8-inch baking tin with plastic wrap.', 'Sift 25 g of cornstarch and icing sugar into a small bowl and combine.

Today, the use of store-bought cans of pumpkin purée is commonplace, but of course, a purée made from scratch is no doubt of superior taste.

Pound Cake,"A pound of flour, a pound of sugar, a pound of butter, and a pound of eggs — that, in short, is the pound cake. Because there are no leavening agents in a true pound cake, it is essential to cream the butter with sugar very well and to whip the eggs properly — this is crucial since it incorporates air into the batter which helps the cake rise. Although simple, this cake is incredibly versatile and can hold any flavor imaginable, from spices like mace, cinnamon, and cloves, to dried fruits. Modern iterations of the recipe will include raising agents which will produce a lighter cake. Commonly a part of butter or all of it is replaced with oil which results in a more moist cake. Proportions of the ingredients can also vary depending on the recipe, and the use of sour cream in place of butter is quite common. Pound cake is usually baked in either a round, a loaf or a bundt pan and is commonly served dusted with sugar, glazed or iced.","United Kingdom, Europe",3.9,"['1 lb (450g) sugar (2 cups)', '1 lb (450g) butter, room temperature', '1 lb (450g) flour, sifted with salt (4 cups before sifting)', '1 dozen eggs', '1⁄4 tsp salt', '1⁄4 cup (60 ml) fresh lemon juice', '1 tbsp fresh lemon rind, grated']",24,25min,1h 30min,-,1h 55min,TasteAtlas,"['Set the oven to preheat to 325°F/160°C.', 'First, cream the butter with sugar until pale and fluffy, then start adding the eggs one by one, beating after each addition.', 'Add the flour in batches, a ½ cup at a time.', 'Lastly, add the lemon rind and the lemon juice.', 'Pour the batter into an oiled and floured loaf pan.', 'Bake for 75-90 minutes — the cake is done when a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.']",https://www.tasteatlas.com/pound-cake/recipe,-

Alternatively, the crust can be made with anything from wafers, chocolate cookies, even sugar cones, and cornflakes, while the standard vanilla custard, depending on the recipe, can be additionally flavored and decorated with, for example, coconut, chocolate, or bananas.

Classic Grits,"One of the most characteristic breakfast dishes of the American South, grits are essentially a porridge made from dried, hulled and ground corn kernels cooked in water or other liquid, and seasoned with salt and butter. White, yellow, or blue corn can be used, and the process starts with hominy, dried corn kernels from which the hull has been removed by soaking them in water mixed with lime mineral, wood ash, or other alkaline products. Dried and ground hominy is called hominy grits, or simply grits, and it is available in four varieties. Whole-ground or stone-ground grits are the coarsest, regular grits are medium ground, quick grits are ground finely, while instant grits have the finest texture. As a dish, grits are usually prepared in heavy-based cooking pans, either in salted water or other liquids such as milk, cream, or chicken stock. The cooking is done slowly, over low heat, stirring constantly, until the texture becomes creamy and thick. Whole-ground grits need to be cooked for 40 to 60 minutes, while instant grits can be prepared in a matter of seconds just by adding boiling water. Typically, a chunk of butter is stirred in at the very end, while other seasonings and additions include pepper and paprika, cheese, bacon, or eggs. Although it is primarily a breakfast dish, grits is an essential part of another Southern US specialty called shrimp and grits, which is a popular dinner entrée. Finally, grits shouldn’t be confused with polenta as grits are made from flint or dent corn varieties whose kernels have had their hull removed, while polenta, typically made in Italy, is made from another corn variety called field corn, and the hull is left intact.","Southern United States, United States Of America",4.4,"['1 cup hominy (grits)', '4 cups water', '2 tsp salt', '1 small lump butter or 1/2 cup milk or thin cream', 'a small piece of lard or cooking oil']",4,-,1h,-,1h,TasteAtlas,"['Grease a large pot with a small piece of lard or with some cooking oil.', 'Pour in the water, bring it to a boil, and then add salt.', 'Pour the hominy (grits) into the salted water.

The Soviet Cookbook Cranberry Kissel,"Depending on how much thickener is added, this Russian dessert can be eaten as a dessert or drunk as a beverage. The basic recipe consists of only sugar, water, thickener and fruit, typically cranberries, cherries, strawberries, redcurrants, gooseberry, and raspberry, but any berry or fruit will do. The preparation starts with extracting as much juice from the fruit, then boiling some of the juice with sugar until it turns into a syrup. A thickener is added next, usually, potato starch which has been previously dissolved in water, and the syrup is stirred until it thickens. The reserved fruit juice is added last, and the kissel is stirred until smooth.

Space Cake,"Belonging to a group of cannabis-infused edibles and originating from Amsterdam, space cake is typically a simple sponge cake, which can be enriched with additional ingredients, such cocoa or chocolate, vanilla extract, dried fruits, nuts, chocolate chips, various spices, and such. The batter is usually made with flour, eggs, sugar, butter, milk, and baking powder, although recipes can vary. The key ingredient, though, is butter infused with cannabis, also known as cannabutter — typically, the crushed or ground cannabis is simmered with melted butter and water. Still, other preparation methods are possible, but the butter will not be infused with as much THC. The baked cake can be dusted with confectioner's sugar, glazed, or frosted.

Traditional Reims Pain D’Épices,"This delicacy, whose name directly translates as spiced bread”, is made with rye flour, wheat flour, or a combination of the two. There are as many variations of the recipe for pain d’épices as there are regions in France, but the two most famous are the original from Reims, made with dark rye flour and without the addition of milk and eggs, and a version from Dijon made with wheat flour. The most commonly-used spices for pain d’épices are cardamom, cloves, nutmeg, ginger, and anise, the last of which is used especially in the Dijon version, while the Reims version always requires at least a pinch of cinnamon. Orange and lemon zest are also added in other regional variants of the recipe. Honey is the most important part of the recipe, and the variety of honey used should, therefore, be carefully chosen, as its aroma will dominate the taste of the bread. Many recipes suggest that rich kinds of honey like pine honey work best. Le Syndicat des Biscuits et Gâteaux de France has reserved the name pain d’épices pur miel for bread sweetened only with honey, as many cooks today add sugar in addition to honey. To add extra crunch and flavor to this traditional gingerbread, feel free to mix various fruits and nuts into the dough.","Reims, France",4.1,"['170 ml (3/4 cup) water', '250g (3/4 cup) real honey (flower honey)', '250g (2 ½ cups) rye flour', '50g (1/4 cup) brown sugar', '1 tsp of bicarbonate / baking soda', '1/2 tsp of salt', '8 -10g (2 tsp) gingerbread spice or the following mixture, according to your taste and the power of your spices:', '1 tsp of ground cinnamon', '1 tsp of ground ginger', '1 tsp of ground anise', '1/2 tsp of ground cloves', '1/2 tsp of ground nutmeg']",10,50min,50min,-,1h 40min,TasteAtlas,"['Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F.

Juane De Gallina,"Juane is a traditional delicacy hailing from the Peruvian Amazon, typically consisting of seasoned rice and chicken wrapped in bijao leaves, the type of juane known as juane de gallina. The recipe starts with preparing the rice, which is combined with seasoned vegetables and, in some cases, beaten eggs. This richly seasoned rice is then laid out on a large bijao leaf, and one seasoned and browned chicken leg is positioned vertically in the center of the rice. Additionally, often, half a hard-boiled egg and an olive are set atop the rice as well. The leaf is then folded around this filling, creating a neat packet, which is subsequently secured with string. Finally, these packets are cooked or steamed until the ingredients inside fuse and the leaves infuse the parcel with flavor. However, Peru's rich culinary diversity has given rise to multiple variations of this classic dish. The sarajuane, for instance, swaps out the rice for a rich blend of ground raw peanuts, corn, and chicken broth. The juane de yuca has ground yucca and fish as ingredients. The juane de chonta introduces the slightly nutty and crunchy texture of chopped chonta, also known as hearts of palm, to the rice mixture. For meat lovers, the avispajuane is a treat, containing ground pork in the rice and pieces of fried chicken. In contrast, the ninajuane moves away from rice entirely and instead mixes pieces of chicken with beaten egg, while chunchullijuane uses chicken giblets instead of standard chicken. And lastly, there is poroto juane, which features ground ""puspo poroto"" beans instead of rice with a chicken piece at the center. Juane is typically served with fried plantain and cocona and chili salsa but also plantain mash tacacho, cassava, or boiled bananas.","San Martín, Peru",3.8,"['2 garlic cloves', '500g (1.1 lbs) rice', '750 ml (3 cups) beef stock', '4 chicken legs', '1/2 tbsp salt', '1/2 tbsp pepper', '1/2 tbsp cumin', '1 tbsp butter', '1 onion', '4 garlic cloves', '2 tbsp turmeric', '4 tomatoes', '1/2 tbsp oregano', '2 laurel leaves', '2 bunches of sacha culantro (jungle cilantro) – use cilantro as substitute', '5 aji dulce (small sweet chili peppers) – use other types of chili as substitute or bell peppers for no spice', '250 ml (1 cup) beef stock', 'salt and pepper, to taste', '4 eggs (to beat)', '2 boiled eggs', '4 bijao leaves – you can find these in Latin American supermarkets or substitute with banana leaves or foil', 'olives']",4,1h,2h,-,3h,TasteAtlas,"['In a large sauté pan, begin by heating vegetable oil.

The Original 1953 Coronation Chicken,"Created for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, coronation chicken or poulet reine Elizabeth is a cold dish consisting of poached and shredded chicken slathered in a mayonnaise-based, curry-flavored sauce. Originally it was served on one side of an oblong dish with a side of rice salad on the other. The rice salad is made with cooked rice, cooked peas, diced raw cucumber, and finely chopped mixed herbs, all combined with a seasoned French dressing. However, coronation chicken has lost much of its grandeur over the years, becoming a cafeteria staple and a sandwich filling. These days, recipes include other ingredients as well, most notably raisins, crème fraîche, and flaked almonds.

Escoffier'S Recipe For Pêche Melba,"Peach Melba is a simple fruit dessert created by the legendary Auguste Escoffier.

In the center, the chef placed a silver cup filled with vanilla ice cream and topped it with poached and chilled peaches. He then decorated his creation with spun sugar. Escoffier allegedly first made the dessert for the renowned Australian singer Helen Porter Mitchell, who was better known as Dame Nellie Melba. It is believed that the dessert got its final form, which included the raspberry sauce, as well as the current name (pêche Melba), several years later when Escoffier worked at the London’s Ritz Carlton Hotel.

Michetta,"Characterized by a bulged exterior, hollow insides, and a shape reminiscent of a flower or a star, michetta is one of the key gastronomic symbols of Milano, along with ossobucco alla Milanese, panettone, cassoeula, and many more. The preparation is a lengthy one, and a few rules have to be followed to get the desired outcome. The first phase is making what Italians call biga, a pre-ferment consisting of flour, yest, and water that has to rest anywhere from 16 to 20 hours in a cold place. The second phase takes place the following day when flour, water, malt, and salt are added to biga, making sure the salt is added last. Once well kneaded and rested, the dough is to be divided into balls ranging between 50 and 90 grams. Each piece is then passed through a pasta machine three times. After each time, the dough should be rolled into a bun and left to rest, covered, for 10 to 30 minutes. Lastly, a mold is pressed into each piece of dough which are then baked in a 240-260°C steam oven.

Bara Brith,"This spiced tea loaf can be prepared in two different ways. The more traditional version uses leavened dough, but as the dough needs time to rise, the unleavened cake version is much more common. Recipes for bara brith tend to not differ much, except in the type of flour they use, and each recipe can be adapted to suit personal tastes. The cake version is usually made with self-rising flour instead of all-purpose flour, but every other ingredient besides the dried fruit, eggs, and brown sugar is optional. The dark tea that is often included in recipes is used to rehydrate the dried fruit overnight and to provide moisture to the cake, although recipes that include no tea get their moisture from milk and water. Other typical ingredients include butter and lard, molasses, spices, honey, marmalade, fruit juice, candied fruit peel, and salt. Whiskey can also be added, if desired. Once baked, the cake version is typically glazed with honey, but both types of bara brith are thickly sliced and buttered when served.

Parrozzo Abruzzese,"Parrozzo is a traditional Christmas dessert that hails from Abruzzo. It is a dome-shaped, chocolate-covered sponge cake made with almonds and semolina. Traditionally, this cake is flavored with bitter almonds, but many contemporary versions add amaretto liqueurs or bitter almond extracts. This dessert was first created in 1920 by Luigi D'Amico, a pastry chef from Pescara who was inspired by the rustic corn bread called pane rozzo. D'Amico went on to protect his creation and started to produce the dessert on an industrial scale. The original recipe has never been disclosed, and it has probably changed since it was invented, but many locals prepare homemade versions that closely resemble the original creation. The dessert is made by combining almond flour, semolina, eggs, sugar, and flavorings. The batter is poured into a special, dome-shaped aluminum mold.

Classic Meatloaf,"A dish firmly labeled as a homemade specialty, meatloaf is a popular, economic and, most of all, versatile way of preparing ground meat. Most common meat choices include beef, veal, pork, and turkey, which are expanded with milk-soaked bread crumbs and bound together with eggs. Very often, the meat is enriched with sautéed onions, garlic, celery, and carrots, which help retain moisture. Filling the meatloaf is also a popular option, and usually includes hard boiled eggs, spinach, bacon, cheese, peppers, dried fruit, spinach and other leafy vegetables such as spinach or Swiss chard. The ingredients are combined by hand in a large bowl and seasoned at the very end with salt, pepper, paprika, powdered garlic, and herbs. Next, the mixture is formed into a shape of a log or placed into a loaf baking pan and baked at 350˚F for 60 to 75 minutes. Classic American recipes often suggest glazing the meatloaf with ketchup and serving it with mashed potatoes and green beans.

Grechnevaya Kasha – Buckwheat Porridge,"When it comes to Russian cuisine, kasha is rightfully considered a staple food, holding the second place on the most beloved dish list right after shchi — cabbage soup. This fact is proved by an old Russian saying: “Shchi da kasha – pishcha nasha”, meaning “Shchi and kasha are our kind of food”. Kasha is actually a nutritious porridge made with cereals or pseudocereals, which can be served for breakfast, dinner, as a side dish usually paired with soup or an individual meal. The beauty of kasha is in its versatility — it can be sweet or savory, and as simple or complex as desired. Typically, the preparation of kasha starts with rinsing and soaking the cereals (buckwheat, millet, rice, wheat or oat), cooking them in water, milk or even broth and seasoning with either salt or sugar. Usually, the ratio between cereals and liquid is 1:2, and the cooking time depends on the type of cereals used. Other than cereals, roughly ground flours such as semolina and cornmeal can also be used. The density of kasha can be adjusted to taste — crumbly porridge is most commonly served as a garnish, while liquid porridge called razmazanya is a usual breakfast option, especially when it is made with milk. Kasha is often topped with butter, and other additions include fresh or dried fruit and vegetables, nuts, eggs, ham, bacon, eggs, cheese, spices, honey and even chocolate. The trick for a perfect kasha lies in cooking it slowly, without stirring (with the exception on flour-based varieties), preferably in a cast-iron skillet. Some recipes suggest placing the boiled kasha in a hot oven so it develops a crust, and the dish is regularly served hot.","Russia, Europe",3.3,"['1 cup buckwheat groats', '2 cups water', 'salt to taste', '30 g vegetable oil', 'butter to taste']",2,-,15min,-,15min,TasteAtlas,"['Wash buckwheat groats several times or under running water.', 'Transfer them to an adequate-sized pot, and cover with water.', 'Add salt and vegetable oil.

Classic Ranch Dressing,"Creamy, herby, and simple to make, ranch sauce is by far the most popular salad dressing in the USA. However, it is also commonly used as a dip for chips, fried foods, and vegetables, or as a condiment in burgers, pizzas, and sandwiches. Although there are many industrial versions available, ranch dressing can easily be prepared at home. Mayonnaise, buttermilk, and sometimes sour cream are whisked in a bowl, while fresh onions and garlic are crushed into a paste with some salt. Alternatively, powdered garlic and onion can also be used. Fresh or dried herbs, typically chives, parsley, and dill, are stirred in, and to finish, the dressing is seasoned with salt, pepper, and mustard.

Game Meat Terrine,"A close relative of pâté, the term terrine denotes both the dish and the earthenware vessel in which it is cooked. The preparation starts with lining the mold with fatback, which is the traditional choice, but today, the preferred option of many chefs is either ham, prosciutto, bacon, spinach, and even seaweed. However, often recipes call for no liners or use plastic wrap instead. To prepare, the meats, and sometimes fish and/or vegetables, which have been previously roughly chopped are mixed together with garnishings and put on top of the chosen liner, which is then folded over the mixture, and the assembled terrine is covered with a tight-fitting lid and baked in a water bath. Once cooked, the terrine is weighed down with a heavy object, and when cooled, stored in the refrigerator for two to three days, so all the flavors can develop and mature. For serving, the terrine is unmolded and cut into slices which are eaten as an entrée with bread and perhaps a salad.","France, Europe",4.1,"['2 kg (4.4 lbs) game meat (deer or wild boar) boneless', '2 shallots', '1 carrot', '12 juniper berries', '1 L (4 cups + 4 tbsp) dry white wine', '3 tbsp of Armagnac', '1 bouquet garni', '2 slices of bacon', '350g (12.3 oz) sausage meat', '200g (7 oz) ground veal', 'salt', 'pepper']",8,40min,2h,2d 0h,2d 2h,TasteAtlas,"['Cut the game meat into thin strips.

Grilled Peanut Butter And Jelly Sandwich,"To prepare, all that is needed is to spread one bread slice with peanut butter, and the other with fruit jelly, then sandwich the bread slices, so the spreads are in the middle. The bread of choice is soft, white bread, which can be toasted, or replaced with French toast, banana bread, and sourdough or similar artisan-style breads. The most popular fruit jellies are strawberry and grape, but any kind can be used to make the sandwich. Slices of fruit and honey can also be used instead, and some recipes even include applewood-smoked bacon in place of jelly. The fluffernutter, a sandwich in its own right, is a variation of the PB&J sandwich, with marshmallow fluff instead of jelly. For more flavor and texture, the sandwich can be grilled or fried, usually after it's been dipped in eggs and cereal coating.","United States Of America, North America",3,"['2 tsp butter', '1 tsp peanut butter', '2 tsp any flavor fruit jelly', '2 slices white bread']",1,5min,8min,-,13min,TasteAtlas,"['Heat a griddle or a skillet to 175°C.', 'Spread one side of each bread slice with butter, then spread the unbuttered side of one bread slice with peanut butter, and spread the unbuttered side of the other bread slice with jelly.', 'Sandwich the two slices, so the peanut butter and jelly are in the middle.', 'Grill for about 4 minutes per side.']",https://www.tasteatlas.com/peanut-butter-and-jelly-sandwich/recipe,-
Mince Pie,"Mince pie is a classic sweet pie that has been commonly enjoyed during the Christmas season in most of the English-speaking world for centuries. Mince pie consists of a soft and crumbly shortcrust pastry shell and a gorgeously aromatic filling (mincemeat) made with various dried fruits, spices, and spirits. Unlike traditional shortcrust pastry, mince pies are made with a bit more butter, which gives the pastry an even softer and richer texture. Initially, the filling included minced meat, and the pie was rectangularly shaped to resemble the manger Jesus had been laid in. Today, mince pies are bite-sized snacks typically made without meat, but suet (hard beef or mutton fat) still plays a vital role in preparing the filling. Much like with confit, once hardened, suet creates a protective layer that helps preserve the mincemeat for a very long time. Thanks to mincemeat’s commercial availability, preparing mince pies has become a fairly quick and simple process; granted, homemade mincemeat is yet to find its commercial match. What is beautiful about mince pies is that they are an incredibly versatile dish that can be sweet and savory, meatatarian or vegetarian, yet equally delicious in all forms. Once baked, mince pies are traditionally dusted with icing sugar and served with a dollop of brandy butter (hard sauce).","England, Europe",4.1,"['2 cups + 3 tbsp (350g) all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting the work surface', '1 cup (225g) unsalted butter (or an equal mix of butter and lard), cold and cubed', '1 pinch salt', '1 egg, beaten', 'cold water, as needed', '3 oz (90g) raisins', '2 oz (55g) dried currants', '2 oz (55g) candied mixed peel, finely chopped', '3 oz (90g) suet (shredded, beef, or vegetarian)', '1/4 lb (115g) dark brown sugar', '1/4 tsp freshly grated nutmeg', '1 tsp mixed spice', '1/2 lemon, grated zest and juice', '1/2 orange, grated zest and juice', '1/2 apple (Bramley or cooking apple), cored and finely chopped', '2 tbsp brandy', ""2 tbsp confectioners' sugar""]",12,40min,2h 50min,3h,6h 30min,TasteAtlas,"['One day in advance, make the mincemeat by combining all the ingredients (except the brandy) in a large baking dish.

Classic Zenzai,"A type of shiruko or oshiruko, a traditional Japanese dessert, zenzai is a simple dish which can be enjoyed hot or cold, depending on the region and the season. It is made with boiled sweet red azuki beans and sweet rice cakes called mochi or glutinous rice flour dumplings dango. The preparation is rather simple, but it may take some time, depending on the basic ingredient. If zenzai is made with dried red azuki beans, they need to be cooked until they become completely soft, which can take up to 2 hours. Canned azuki beans take shorter to cook, and the quickest way to prepare zenzai is to dilute anko — sweet red bean paste which can be coarse or smooth. Hence, the texture of zenzai can vary — it can look like a dense soup with whole red beans in it; the beans can be partially smashed, or puréed completely. The version with puréed beans is most commonly enjoyed in eastern Japan, where zenzai goes by the name of shiruko or oshiruko and has a thinner consistency than regular zenzai. The bean soup is typically sweetened with white or brown sugar and garnished with grilled mochi or dango. As a contrast to its sweetness, zenzai is often served with pickled plums or salty seaweed.","Japan, Asia",2.2,"['1 cup red azuki beans', '1 ½ cup sugar', '1 ½ cup sugar', 'salt', '6 mochi']",6,-,2h 30min,-,2h 30min,TasteAtlas,"['Place red beans and 4 to 5 cups of water in a pot.

Classic German Chocolate Cake,"With quite an extensive list of ingredients, German chocolate cake is rather easy to make for someone familiar with basic cooking techniques. The first step is to melt the chocolate with some water in a microwave oven or over a double boiler. Egg whites are mixed in one bowl; dry ingredients such as flour, baking soda and salt in another; and butter, sugar and egg yolks in the third. The melted chocolate is blended with the egg yolk mixture, followed by flour mixture and buttermilk. In the end, the mixed egg whites are gently combined, so the batter gets plenty of air, which will result in a spongy texture. The batter is then divided into three baking pans and baked for 30 minutes. When cooled, each layer is covered with a pecan-coconut frosting, which is also applied on top. The sides can be left unglazed, or covered with chocolate frosting, and some maraschino cherries may be used to garnish the top.","United States Of America, North America",3.2,"['1 pack (4 oz) Baker’s German’s Sweet Chocolate', '1/2 cup water', '4 eggs, separated', '2 cups flour', '1 tsp baking soda', '1/4 tsp salt', '1 cup butter, softened', '2 cups sugar', '1 tsp vanilla', '1 cup buttermilk', '4 egg yolks', '12 oz evaporated milk', '1 – 1/2 tsp vanilla', '1 – 1/2 cups sugar', '3/4 cup butter or margarine', '1 pack (7 oz or 2-2/3 cups) coconut, sweetened', '1-1/2 cups chopped pecans']",16,45min,30min,-,1h 15min,TasteAtlas,"['Take three 9-inch round pans, cover them with baking paper and grease.

Cantonese-Style Mooncakes With Lotus Seed Paste And Salted Egg Yolks,"An elaborate Chinese dessert, mooncake is quite a challenge even for the most experienced cooks. Its preparation requires time and patience, especially when it comes to assembling. The first step is to choose the filling, which can be sweet or savory. The most popular fillings include lotus seed paste, various bean pastes, mixed nuts, sesame seed paste, while pork is a favorite in the savory department. Salted duck egg yolk is often incorporated into the middle of a mooncake and has a strong symbolic meaning. The sweet fillings are made by soaking, cooking, and mashing the beans and seeds, which are then cooked in a pan with sugar, oil or butter, and a little salt, so the liquid evaporates, and the paste becomes dry and dough-like. The dough, on the other hand, is made by kneading flour with fat (traditionally lard, nowadays vegetable oil), lye water, and inverted sugar syrup or honey. The following steps are all about precision. The dough and the fillings are precisely divided into individual portions and weighed carefully, so each mooncake is identical to the other. The dough is then wrapped around a filling to form a small ball. The mooncakes get their final shape by being pressed in wooden or plastic mooncake molds. Elaborate imprints on the top usually contain Chinese characters for harmony or longevity or depict a moon, a rabbit, flowers, and other designs with symbolic significance. Finally, once assembled, mooncakes are baked for 20-25 minutes, but they need to be stored in an airtight container for 1-2 days to become moist and soft enough to eat. Usually, they are served during the Mid-Autumn Festival, dedicated to the mythical Moon Goddess, and they are considered a beautiful and sophisticated present for business partners and respected relatives.","Guangdong, China",3.1,"['150g (5.3 oz) dried lotus seeds', '120g (4.2 oz) caster sugar', '80g (2.8 oz) vegetable oil', '1/2 tsp salt', '180g (6.3 oz) plain flour', '125g (4.4 oz) honey', '1/8 tsp (0,5g) dietary alkali', '55g (2 oz) groundnut oil', '20 salted eggs', '1 egg yolk', '1 tbsp egg white']",20,40min,2h 35min,2d 12h,2d 15h,TasteAtlas,"['First, prepare the lotus seeds by soaking them in water for 6-8 hours.

Lombard Torrone From Cremona,"Present in every corner of Italy, the Italian nougat or torrone usually comes in the form of bars and is made with honey, sugar, egg whites, and toasted nuts, usually almonds, hazelnuts, and pistachio. Its texture can range from soft and chewy (torrone morbido or torrone tenero), to hard and brittle (torrone duro), which is determined by the length of cooking. Apart from the basic ingredients, the torrone can also include chocolate, dried or candied fruit, orange or lemon zest, other nuts such as walnuts or sesame seeds, and glucose syrup. The preparation is simple, but in most cases, quite time-consuming. The first step is to toast the nuts, which can be left whole or chopped coarsely. Honey and sugar are melted in separate bowls over a bain-marie — the honey should become liquid, while the sugar should be brought to the point of caramelization. The honey and sugar syrup are then joined, mixed with whipped egg whites and preferred nuts, and cooked. Cooking may last from just a few minutes to up to 8 hours, depending on the recipe, and the mixture needs to be stirred constantly. Then, the torrone mixture is poured into a special rectangular wooden mold or a non-stick baking dish lined with edible wafer paper ostia, which is used to prevent future torrone bars from sticking. Alternatively, torrone can be shaped without a mold on a marble slab with the help of a rolling pin or a metal spatula. The hot mixture is flattened, so it's 1 to 3 cm high, and covered with another sheet of wafer paper. After being cooled slightly, the torrone is cut into pieces of the desired size — which can range from long rectangular bars to small, bite-sized cubes — and left to cool completely. Since it is rich in sugar, which serves as a preserving agent, torrone can keep for months but should be stored in an air-tight container and kept in a cool place. When it comes to regional varieties, the possibilities are endless. Probably the most famous version of torrone comes from the city of Cremona in the northern-Italian region of Lombardy, where it is made with almonds, honey, sugar syrup, and egg whites, and can be found in both varieties — soft and hard. The neighboring region Piedmont is known for the use of hazelnuts in their torrone, especially in the cities of Alba, Asti, and Cuneo. On the other hand, the Veneto region has its own name for the torrone — mandorlato — which suggests that the preferred nut is the almond. Central Italian regions, particularly Tuscany, Marche, and Abruzzo, opt for a soft torrone: the Tuscan variety often includes dried fruit, while in Abruzzo chocolate is added to the mixture. If we go further south, it is noticeable that the egg whites tend to be omitted from the recipes. For instance, in the city of Naples in Campania, torrone is made with chocolate and hazelnuts and is traditionally prepared for the All Saints Day in honor of the deceased, carrying a macabre name torrone dei morti (lit. torrone of the dead). Despite its deceptive name, the Calabrese torrone gelato doesn’t include any ice cream, but it is heavily studded with candied fruit and coated with chocolate. Calabria and Sicily share a torrone variety based on sesame seeds called giuggulena. When it comes to Sicilian varieties, there is cubbaita, made with almond and pistachios, and minnulata, made with almonds — and both are enhanced with citrus zest. Although it is most commonly associated with Christmas, the torrone is prepared and enjoyed throughout the year and can be found virtually everywhere — in supermarkets, street markets, fairs, artisanal pastry shops, or as a part of elaborated desserts in fancy restaurants.","Italy, Europe",4.4,"['20 wafer papers', '200 g sugar', '200 g honey', '50 ml water', '500 g hazelnuts or almonds', '1 sachet vanilla sugar', '2 egg whites', 'zest from 1 lemon']",8,15min,1h,-,1h 15min,TasteAtlas,"['Mix water with sugar over low heat until it caramelizes.', 'Meanwhile, roast the hazelnuts or almonds.', 'Melt the honey in a bain-marie.

Classic Acar Mentah,"Sweet, salty, and sour at the same time, acar is a simple Indonesian salad made from vegetables and, sometimes, fruit. Most commonly, it is made from cucumbers, carrots, shallots, and chilies cut into small, bite-sized pieces cured in a brine made with water, vinegar, sugar, and salt. Additional ingredients may include peppers, long beans, cabbage, pineapples, and mango. If acar is made with fresh vegetables, it is called acar mentah, meaning raw acar. On the other hand, the vegetables can also be cooked shortly in brine, and, in that case, they are seasoned with turmeric powder, nuts, and other spices. Acar can be served on the side of various grilled and fried dishes, or as a topping for rice and noodles. Sometimes, acar becomes an ingredient in more complex meat and seafood dishes, which get a pop of color thanks to this simple, but tasty dish.","Indonesia, Asia",3.4,"['1 kg (35 1/4 oz) fresh cucumber', '2 carrots', '3 shallots', '1 clove garlic', '1 tsp fine salt', '2 tbsp vinegar', '3 cayenne peppers', '3 tbsp sugar']",8,10min,-,-,10min,TasteAtlas,"['Remove the ends from the cucumber and cut them into sticks.', 'Peel the carrots and cut them into sticks as well.', 'Thinly slice the garlic, cayenne pepper, and shallots.', 'Season with vinegar, sugar, and salt and serve.']",https://www.tasteatlas.com/acar/recipe,-

Mild Sloppy Joe,"“Abandon table manners all ye who eat Sloppy Joe” – this warning, if any, gives the best description of this messy, filling, and economic sandwich. Apart from being one of the most popular fast foods, Sloppy Joe is often served at birthday and barbecue parties and is one of the most popular lunches in the American school cafeterias. Its preparation is quite simple and requires no special ingredients. First, a little oil is heated in a skillet to brown some finely chopped vegetables. This usually involves onions and green bell peppers, although some recipes suggest adding mushrooms, fresh tomatoes, and grated carrots. The meat and vegetables are cooked until they soften, and the liquid reduces, and then the sauce is seasoned with Worcestershire sauce, tomato sauce and/or ketchup, salt, and pepper. To make it spicier, you can also use Tabasco, ground pepper, and mustard. The hot sauce is spooned on split hamburger buns and served with plenty of napkins on the side — since with Sloppy Joe elegance has no room at the table.","United States Of America, North America",3.8,"['1 lb ground beef', '1 cup ketchup', '1/4 cup water', '2 tbsp brown sugar', '2 tsp Worcestershire sauce', '2 tsp prepared mustard', '1/2 tsp garlic powder', '1/2 tsp onion powder', '1/2 tsp salt', '4 hamburger buns, split']",4,5min,35min,-,40min,TasteAtlas,"['Heat a large saucepan and add the meat.', 'Cook the meat over medium heat until it browns, then drain the excess fluid.', 'Add ketchup, water, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, onion powder, and garlic powder.

Leningrad Rassolnik,"Hailed by Russians as the best hangover cure, rassolnik soup, whether made meatless or vegetarian, always has pickles and their brine as the main ingredients. The preparation typically starts with making a meat or a vegetable broth, boiling the innards or giblets (veal, beef, poultry, and lamb) and sautéing or baking the root vegetables. Once the broth has been strained, chopped kidneys or liver (and sometimes meat) are added to it together with vegetables, herbs, and spices. At this point, barley which has been previously soaked in water or boiled is also added to the soup. The staple ingredient of this dish, pickles are chopped and before being added to the soup are either sautéed with other vegetables, separately simmered, or just added directly to the soup without any prior preparation; however, they are almost always added to the soup near the end of cooking together with pickle brine. Of course, different chefs will have their method of preparation that may differ from the one outlined here, but typically these will be only slight variations. To make the perfect rassolink, irregardless of the version, the most important thing is to have the adequate amount of neutral vegetables in the soup to balance out the salty and the sour ones. Although it can be prepared with any meat or fish, this soup is often prepared only with vegetables; the one made with mushrooms is an especially noted vegetarian version. Two Russian cities, Moscow and St.Petersburg, have their signature rassolnik soups. The one prepared in Moscow is made with chicken broth and either chicken and duck meat, served topped with an egg mixture and a side of pies that have a sour cottage cream filling. St. Petersburg version, officially called the Leningrad rassolnik is served with a dollop of sour cream and is prepared instead with beef broth, tomato paste and barley.","Russia, Europe",3.2,"['300 g lean beef', '3-4 potatoes', '1-2 onions', '1 carrot', '50 g pearl barley (dry)', '4 pickled cucumbers', 'sour cream']",2,20min,1h,-,1h 20min,TasteAtlas,"['The first step is to soak the barley overnight.

19th Century Boston Baked Beans,"This New England staple is made with white beans, such as Navy beans or yellow eye beans, molasses, salt pork, and mustard. To prepare, the presoaked beans are mixed with the remaining ingredients and then slow-cooked overnight. Traditionally, the beans would have been cooked in a clay pot in an ember-filled hole in the ground. However, in today's recipes, to cut on time, beans are typically either boiled or simmered until softened or cooked, then mixed with the remaining ingredients in either a casserole or a Dutch oven and slow-cooked in the oven anywhere from four to eight hours, depending on the recipe. Although not traditional, sugar is also often included in the ingredients, as well as onion, pepper and other aromatics which add deep, complex flavor to the dish. If cooked to perfection, Boston baked beans will have a caramelized crust on top and underneath a thick stew of beans coated in a glaze-like sauce.

The cream of tartar, lemon juice, and salt are added to stabilize the foam, while various extracts are used to add additional flavor to the cake, such as lemon, almond, vanilla, and orange.

Bolo De Mel,"Bolo de mel is the oldest Madeiran cake dating from the 15th century. It is traditionally made on December 8 in large quantities and meant to be eaten for Christmas and then enjoyed throughout the coming year. The key ingredient and the one cake was named after is mel de cana, a local sugarcane molasses responsible for its long shelf life. The cake is made with yeasted dough that is rich in butter, lard, nuts, and mel de cana, bursting with flavors of spices, Madeira wine, and candied citrus peel. The preparation is simple yet time-consuming, mainly because the cake needs a lot of proving time — up to 3 days, depending on the recipe. The top of the cake is typically decorated with a flower motif made with nuts.

Basic Oatmeal Bannocks,"Simple in preparation and diverse in variations, bannock is a poor’s man dish from Scotland which could best be described as a dense flatbread of neutral taste. The preparation starts with the grains, which usually come in the form of oatmeal, barleymeal, rye meal or peasemeal. The grains are mixed with salt and sodium bicarbonate, the latter being a modern addition. Fats, such as lard, bacon fat, or butter, are rubbed into the mixture, which is bound together with a small amount of liquid, usually water or buttermilk. Although bannock is most commonly neutral or savory, there are also sweet bannock recipes, which suggest adding sultanas or candied citrus peel to the dough. After being assembled, the dough is rolled and shaped into a flat circle or cut into individual portions. Finally, it is baked in a pan or an oven until it browns slightly. Warm bannocks can be served with butter, fruit jams, fresh cheese, salmon, soups, and stews, and can keep well for days.","Scotland, Europe",3.9,"['125 g medium oatmeal', '2 tsp melted fat (bacon fat, if available)', '2 pinches bicarbonate of soda', '1 pinch salt', '3/4 tbsp hot water', 'additional oatmeal']",4,10min,15min,-,25min,TasteAtlas,"['Mix the dry ingredients — the oatmeal, salt, and bicarbonate of soda – in a large bowl.', 'Make a well in the middle and pour in the melted fat.', 'Stir well and add enough water to turn into a stiff paste.', 'Sprinkle the surface with additional oatmeal and turn the dough over onto a working surface.', 'Divide the dough in two and roll out each half to be 1/4-inch thick.

Recipes vary from region to region and depend on the available ingredients but can also be adjusted to suit the personal tastes of the chef.

Pfefferpotthast,"The peculiar thing about this rich stew is that it is thickened with pumpernickel as opposed to say flour or roux, which makes it truly unique when compared to most stews. Also, it is very generously seasoned with pepper, clover, bay leaf, and capers, often with an added touch of acidity in the form of lemon peels or lemon juice to balance out the flavors. The preparation begins with sautéeing beef dices in lard, then adding the onions and sautéeing them as well.

Traditional Kutia,"Halfway between porridge and pudding, Ukrainian kutia is a simple, nutritious dish served on festive occasions such as Christmas Eve, Orthodox New Year’s Eve, Epiphany and Easter. The recipe and its ingredients depend on the occasion, the region, and the family tradition. Generally speaking, багата кутя (bahata kutia) or rich kutia is prepared on Christmas Eve and is made with wheat or barley, poppy seeds, honey, nuts and dried fruit, most commonly raisins; one of its main characteristics is that it must be lean. On the other hand, щедра кутя (schedra kutia) or generous kutia is made before the Orthodox New Year (January 14th) and contains the same ingredients as rich kutia but is also enriched with butter, milk, or cream and the occasional splash of wine, cognac or other alcoholic beverages. Finally, голодна кутя (golodna kutia) or hungry kutia is served on Epiphany (January 18th) and is made only with grains and a small amount of sweetener, since on that day a strict fast must be observed. To prepare kutia, one must soak the grains overnight, and cook them in water or milk over low heat until they soften. Poppy seeds are soaked in boiling water and crushed in a mortar or a food processor, while nuts — preferably walnuts — should be coarsely chopped and lightly toasted in an oven or a pan. Finally, cooked grains are mixed with poppy seeds, walnuts, dried fruit, and honey. If kutia is too thick, it may be diluted with liquid from uzvar — Ukrainian dried fruit compote.","Ukraine, Europe",4.7,"['350g wheat grains', '200 g poppy seeds', '200 g walnuts', '150 g raisins', '3 tbsp honey']",4,45min,1h 30min,-,2h 15min,TasteAtlas,"['Wash the wheat grains thoroughly and let them soak overnight in cold water.', 'The next morning, drain and rinse the grains and cook them until tender over low heat, until soft and crumbly.', 'Cool the wheat grains and mix them with 1 tbsp of honey.', 'Place poppy seeds and raisins in separate bowls and soak them in boiling water for 30 minutes.', 'Drain the poppy seeds, add 1 tbsp of honey, and grind them in a blender.', 'Fry the nuts until crispy in a small frying pan.', 'Drain the raisins.', 'Mix the wheat, poppy seeds, and raisins.

Old School Marshmallow Paste,"Even though a jar of factory-produced marshmallow cream is regularly seen in most American home pantries, especially in New England, this simple dessert is surprisingly easy to make from scratch. A simpler version suggests mixing the egg whites with salt and corn syrup, adding powdered sugar, mixing again, and finishing off with a few drops of vanilla extract. On the other hand, a slightly upgraded version uses a candy thermometer while boiling water, corn syrup and sugar to 246˚F, which is then mixed into egg whites whipped with salt, a little sugar, and cream of tartar. The result is a gooey, fluffy, and sweet white cream which can be used as a cake filling or frosting, or as a spread for the kids’ favorite - a fluffernutter sandwich with peanut butter.","Somerville, United States Of America",2.8,"['3/4 cup sugar', '1/4 cup milk', '1/4 lb marshmallows', '2 tbsp hot water', '1/2 tsp vanilla']",4,10min,15min,-,25min,TasteAtlas,"['Bring sugar and milk to boil in a small saucepan without stirring.

Cassava And Plantain Fufu,"In Western and Central African cooking, fufu holds the same position as mashed potatoes do in traditional European and American cuisine. This staple dish is served with all kinds of soups, stews, and sauces, and looks like a soft, slightly elastic white purée of neutral taste. Depending on the country, the ingredients for fufu may differ. In Ghana, fufu is most commonly made by mashing together cassava and unripe plantains or yams. Fufu-like staples are widespread across the entire Sub-Saharan Africa. Apart from the ingredients mentioned earlier, they can also be prepared with cocoyams, cassava flour, maize, rice, semolina, or potato flakes, and even pre-made fufu powder which only needs to be mixed with water and cooked shortly is commonly used. Traditionally, fufu is prepared by boiling peeled cassava and pounding it with unripe plantains and some water in a large wooden mortar using a pestle. Sometimes the cassava and the plantains are pounded separately and combined in the end. As this process is lengthy — it can take up to 2 hours — and labor-intensive, it is usually done by two people — one pounding and the other kneading and turning the mixture. The modern approach suggests processing the ingredients in a food processor and then steaming them shortly while constantly whisking on a low to medium flame. Still, some people find traditional fufu preparation relaxing and perform it after a stressful week. Fufu is regularly eaten by hand. One has to tear off a small, bite-sized ball which is then dipped in soup, stew or sauce. The options are endless, but some of the favorites include groundnut, egwusi (melon), pumpkin, pepper, or okra soup; fish stew and chicken yassa.","Ghana, Africa",3.7,"['300 g (10 1/2 oz) un-ripened plantain', '460 g (16 oz) cassava', '350-450 ml (1 1/2 cup to 2 cups) water for blending', '50 ml (3 tbsp + 1 tsp) water for steaming']",4,20min,20min,-,40min,TasteAtlas,"['First, peel the plantain and cut it into cubes.

Piedmontese Torrone From Alba,"Locally grown hazelnuts are the main ingredient of the Piedmontese torrone, a variety of the ubiquitous Italian nougat coming from the north-western part of Italy and carrying a PAT (Prodotto agroalimentare tradizionale) approval. Apart from hazelnuts, this sweet delicacy is also made with honey, sugar, glucose syrup, and egg whites, while its texture can range from duro (lit. hard) to morbido (lit. soft). To make the classic Piedmontese torrone, one must be equipped with skill and patience. The hazelnuts are toasted briefly in an oven, while the honey, sugar, and glucose syrup are melted in a bain-marie. Whipped egg whites are carefully folded into the mixture until it becomes homogeneous. The mixture is then cooked for up to 8 hours while being stirred constantly, and the hazelnuts are added at the very end. The hot torrone mixture is carefully poured into rectangular wooden molds or a shallow baking dish and flattened to the thickness of 1 to 3 centimeters (½-1-inch) using a rolling pin or a metal spatula. Since the torrone is quite sticky, its top and bottom are covered with edible wafer paper ostia, which has a host-like consistency. When the torrone becomes tepid, it is cut into pieces and left to cool completely.

Classic Kivevé,"Imagine a dish which can be served as a hearty breakfast, makes a great side dish to grilled steaks and roasts, and is also a delicious dessert. This, in short, is the Paraguayan kivevé — a humble, but also a versatile combination of pumpkin, cornmeal, and fresh cheese, whose consistency is similar to porridge or purée. The preparation starts with peeling, deseeding, and dicing a pumpkin, which is then cooked in water until tender, and smashed into a smoother or a coarser purée. A finely chopped onion is sautéed in a separate pan and mixed with the pumpkin purée, the liquid the pumpkin has been cooked in or milk, sugar, and salt. Next, the cornmeal is added while constantly stirring to retain a smooth texture, and the mixture is cooked over low heat for 10 minutes. The final touch is to add fresh cheese and some butter or margarine, which give kivevé a rich, milky taste. As a breakfast or a side dish, kivevé is usually served hot, while cool kivevé is mostly considered a dessert.","Paraguay, South America",4.3,"['1 kg pumpkin', '3 cups water', '2 tbsp oil', '150 g fresh white cheese', '2 cups cornmeal', '1 onion, chopped finely', '1 tsp sugar', '1 cup milk', '1 tsp coarse salt']",6,10min,45min,-,55min,TasteAtlas,"['Peel the pumpkin, cut it into smaller pieces and cook in 3 cups of water until it becomes soft.', 'In a large saucepan, heat the oil and fry the onions.', 'Put the pumpkin and the water it has been cooked in into a blender, and process into a puree.', 'Join the pumpkin puree with the fried onion.

Dundee Cake,"One can instantly recognize this traditional Scottish, sultanas-studded fruitcake by a top pattern of concentric circles made with blanched almonds. The batter made with flour, butter, eggs and sugar is first flavored with Sevilla orange peels and optionally, sherry. Sultanas are added as soon as the batter reaches a consistency that is firm enough to hold the dried fruit, which would then ideally, be evenly distributed in the cake. Traditionally, this is a round cake in which case the almonds are placed on top in concentric rings, or in the case that it's shaped like a slab cake, the almonds placed on top are arranged into neat rows. However, in some recipes almonds may not only serve merely as decoration but are also be added to the batter. The length of baking depends on the size of the cake which should be golden brown and firm to touch when finished. For the best results, the cake should be left to age for up to three days to get it to ripen and develop flavor.

Authentic Macaroni Salad,"An inexpensive way to carbo-load, macaroni salad is a simple crowd-pleaser consisting of elbow macaroni, mayonnaise, carrots, milk, cider vinegar, sugar, salt and pepper to taste. However, ingredients and seasonings such as mustard, allspice, celery, hard-boiled egg, potatoes, onions, peas, and many more, are also often included, depending on the recipe. The important thing is to overcook the pasta as that way it will better soak in the mayonnaise, which is also often thinned out with milk for the same reason. Although it is a dish served cold, it should not be served straight out of the refrigerator, since the salad will be too dry if kept in the refrigerator for long.

Traditional Okoshi,"Richly sweet and featherlight at the same time, okoshi is a simple, yet sophisticated treat which is most often sold by street vendors or in candy stores, but can also be prepared at home. First, cooked or steamed rice is air-dried until it becomes translucent. During this process, rice is stirred regularly to break down any clumps. Then, rice is deep-fried briefly in hot vegetable oil, so it expands. Once it starts floating on the surface and before it turns brown, the rice is removed and left to drain on a paper towel. Drying and frying the rice can be skipped by using store-bought puffed rice. Puffed rice is mixed with sugar syrup, or a well-known Japanese starch-based syrup mizuame, which both serve as binding agents. Butter or margarine and food colorings can also be added, along with various flavorings such as peanuts, sesame, dried fruit, soybeans, caramel, and matcha – powdered green tea. In professional preparation the okoshi mixture is being kneaded for several minutes in special, shallow and wide copper cooking pots, so all the ingredients come together. If the okoshi is prepared at home, the mixture is pressed into glass or plastic containers to keep its form. While it’s still warm and soft, okoshi is cut into square pieces of desired sizes, and served after it has cooled slightly.","Tokyo, Japan",2,"['1 cup (150 g) cooked rice', '40 g sugar', '10 ml water', 'peanuts to taste']",4,24h,10min,-,24h 10min,TasteAtlas,"['Spread the cooked rice on a baking sheet in a thin layer and place it on a flat sieve or a serving tray.', 'Dry the rice in the sunlight: usually, drying takes one day during summer and two days during winter.', 'When the rice becomes translucent and crispy, it is ready for further preparation.

Eliza Acton’S Victorian Christmas Pudding,"Traditionally prepared on Stir-up Sunday, the last Sunday before the start of the Advent season, Christmas pudding is a must serve on Christmas Day in most British households. The recipe is relatively straightforward; flour, breadcrumbs, suet, dried fruits, candied peels, sugar, spices, salt, and alcohol (mostly brandy, but rum and beer are also used) are mixed into a mass. The mass is then pressed into a mold — in the past, the mass was wrapped in a cloth resulting in a cannonball shape — and steamed for several hours. The steamed pudding needs to be stored in a dark and cold place, wrapped in a cloth, to mature until Christmas Day, but can be served immediately. Customarily, the pudding is lit on fire right before it's brought to the table. For a more dramatic effect, the room where the Christmas dinner is served is kept completely dark, so the flaming pudding is distinctly visible as it's being brought in. It is often garnished with a branch of holly. As far as serving is concerned, Christmas pudding is often paired with brandy butter, brandy sauce, custard, or lemon sauce.","England, Europe",4.5,"['75g (2.65 oz) flour', '75g (2.65 oz) breadcrumbs', '150g (5.3 oz) suet', '150g (5.3 oz) raisins', '150g (5.3 oz) currants', '100g (3.5 oz) chopped apple (roughly one large apple)', '125g (4.4 oz) sugar', '50g (1.75 oz) candied peel', '½ tsp mixed spice (or ½ tsp nutmeg + ½ tsp mace)', 'a pinch of salt', '100 ml (⅓ cup + 4 tsp) brandy, plus 50 ml (3 tbsp + 1 tsp) for serving', '3 small eggs, whisked']",6,30min,4h,-,4h 30min,TasteAtlas,"['Add all the dry ingredients to a large bowl and mix them until combined.

Spumone Salentino,"Spumoni or spumone is a molded ice cream dessert, that according to The Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets, is dome-shaped and is made up of two layers — one on the outside is a custard-based ice cream, while the one underneath is either a semifreddo or a parfait. Although there is no fixed recipe, the most common combo is the hazelnut, chocolate, and stracciatella trifecta, with the filling inside. In the past, sponge cake or Savoiardi soaked in some kind of a liqueur or wine, most commonly Marsala, would be the filling of choice. Nowadays, it is more common to find a filing of either almonds, chocolate, candied fruit, or caramel. As far as at-home preparation goes, the typical way of making spumoni is to make a light custard that is flavored with the desired ingredient, then aerated by folding in the meringue. Two or three flavored custards are layered in a dome-shaped container, one on top of the other, with a filling hiding in the center. If ice cream is used, it is often mixed with whipped cream to aerate it, although nowadays this practice is not as common, as most recipes opt for store-bought ice cream, not ones made from scratch. Most noted kinds of spumoni come from the cities Salento, Gallipoli, and Tuglie. In Salento, the typical spumoni is dome-shaped, made up of two layers, a vanilla and a chocolate one, with the filling in the center, typically one consisting of sponge cake and/or crushed hazelnuts or almonds. The one from Gallipoli is made with either chocolate or hazelnut ice cream and is filled with Plombières cream, flavored with either Marsala or Strega liquor, chocolate pieces, and toasted and ground almonds. In Tuglie, on the other hand, meringue is the typical filling. In the United States, the practice is entirely different. There when you talk of spumoni, you are talking most likely of a version consisting of layers of chocolate, either strawberry or cherry, and pistachio ice cream that is large and rectangle-shaped, meant to be cut into slabs for serving. In some cases, vanilla ice cream is used instead of the cherry and strawberry one. The ice creams can be further enriched with different nuts, cherries, cookies, and chocolate. Often, a sponge cake layer or a cookie crumb crust layer can be used as the base for the cake.","Italy, Europe",4,"['300 ml (1 1/4 cup) partially skimmed milk', '4 eggs', '200g (1 cup) sugar', '25g (1 tbsp + 2 tsp) icing sugar', '1 sachet of vanilla sugar', 'sponge cake, as needed', 'liqueur, preferably Marsala, as needed', '300 ml (1 1/4 cup) partially skimmed milk', '4 eggs', '200g (1 cup) sugar', '50g (1/2 cup) cocoa powder', '25g (1 tbsp + 2 tsp) icing sugar', 'chopped hazelnuts or almonds (or chopped biscuits)']",8,20min,10min,6h,6h 30min,TasteAtlas,"['Whisk eggs with sugar and icing sugar.', 'Warm the milk in a saucepan over low heat just shy of a boil.

Basic Natto I,"The ugly duckling of the Japanese cuisine, natto is a dish which can best be described as a thing of an acquired taste — primarily for the non-Japanese. It is a traditional side dish of cooked and fermented soybeans glued together with sticky, gooey threads, and with a strong aroma which some find unpleasant. The first step in preparing natto is washing the dried soybeans and discarding the ones which are broken or discolored. The next step is called shinseki and includes soaking the beans in water for 8 to 24 hours until their form turns from round to oval. The soybeans are then cooked or steamed until they become soft, after which the bacterial starter culture is introduced, and the soybeans are fermented for 24 hours. The starter culture consists of a special bacteria called Bacillus subtilis var. natto, also known as natto-kin in Japan, and is usually sold in the form of a white powder. This powder is dissolved in a little bit of water and combined with cooked or steamed soybeans to start the fermentation process. Alternatively, pre-made natto can simply be mixed with soybeans for the same result. The fermentation usually lasts for 24 hours and is done at a stable temperature from 30 to 45˚F. During that time a mucilaginous texture neba neba is developed around the soybeans, which signals that the fermentation was done properly. Finally, the natto has to age at a low temperature for up to 48 hours, after which it is ready to use. Besides soybean natto, there are other varieties such as kuromame (made with black soybeans), kintokimame (sweet natto made from kintoki beans), and shirohanamame and toramame (made with shirohana and tora beans). The most popular variety of soybean natto is marudaizu, made with whole soybeans. Hikiwari ground natto is made by roasting soybeans, grinding them roughly, discarding the peel and boiling them, while goto-in natto is prepared by combining ground natto with malted rice and salt and aging it in barrels. Like most fermented foods, natto has proven health benefits: it is rich in protein and vitamin K which strengthens the bones, and its enzyme nattokinase is said to prevent blood clots. This dish is most commonly served for breakfast with some rice, soy sauce, karashi mustard, spring onion, and raw egg. It can also be spread over toast or incorporated into various dishes such as sushi, savory pancake okonomiyaki, miso soup, even pasta.","Japan, Asia",3,"['200 g soybeans', '350 ml water', '1 tsp water', '0,2 g natto bacteria']",4,10min,50min,-,1h,TasteAtlas,"['First, inspect the soy grains and remove the broken ones and the ones with uneven coloration.', 'Rinse the soybeans thoroughly and soak them in plenty of water for 12 hours or overnight.', 'Drain the soybeans and place them into a steamer basket of a pressure cooker.

Cuy Al Horno,"Cuy al horno, or over-baked guinea pig, is the hallmark dish of Tipón, a city considered Peru's cuy capital that lies some 25 kilometers outside of Cusco. The typical recipe calls for a guinea pig seasoned with a mixture of salt, cumin, pepper, oil, huacatay, and, occasionally, lemon juice. Once seasoned, the guinea pig is typically left to marinate for up to one day, and before baking, huacatay branches are placed inside its abdominal cavity. Traditionally, it is baked in a wood-fired oven at high temperature.

However, some recipes add boiled potatoes to the sauce, in which case the dish is usually served with white rice. Depending on the region, the dish will also have cumin, Chinese onions, peanuts, the heart and liver of the guinea pig, broth, oregano, raisins, olives, mint, and pisco as ingredients.

Chikwanga,"In Congolese cuisine, chikawanga has the same role as bread does in traditional American and European cuisine — it is a side which can go with almost anything. However, unlike its European and American counterparts, chikawanga has an entirely different texture — it is clay-like and not firm. The preparation is a lengthy one, and it starts with soaking the bitter cassava tubers for a few days, the outer layer can be peeled off before or after soaking. The tubers are then washed a few times, each time in fresh water, which serves to remove as much bitterness as possible. Traditionally, the soaked cassava would be left to drain at this point — most recipes today skip this step — and then, ground in a mortar an pestle. For at home preparation, a grater, an immersion blender, or a food processor can be used instead. Typically, the resulting mass is then kneaded, shaped into 2-inch wide and 12-inches long oblongs and wrapped in magaphyrinum macrostchym leaves which impart the chikwanga with a distinct flavor when steamed. To secure that the leaves stay in place during steaming, chikawanga is tied with rope. Apart from this basic version, there also exist other shapes of chikwanga, such as the mombamda, which is the big version of chikawanga that lasts up to seven days and is cut into smaller portions for consumption. Then there is also nsesa which is smaller than mombamda and keeps for up to four days and ntinga which is distinguished from others by its surface which has an imprint from the leaves in which it was wrapped. No matter the shape, chikawanga is steamed for anywhere from four to eight plus hours. Flavorwise, chikwanga is pretty bland tasting, which makes it a great side to any dish, and is served either warm or at room temperature. The leaves are discarded, and the chikawanga is first softened with fingers and then used as a scoop to pick up sauces, soups, or stews.","Democratic Republic Of The Congo, Africa",3.9,"['2 pounds cassava (yuca) tubers', 'banana leaves, or sheets of aluminum foil']",8,1h 30min,8h,-,9h 30min,TasteAtlas,"['Chop of the ends of the cassava tubers, peel them, cut them into chunks, and place them in a bowl of water to soak for three days.', 'After three days have passed, wash them several times under running water to eliminate as much bitterness as possible.', 'Add the chunks to a mortar and pestle and mash until you have a smooth paste.', 'Divide the resulting paste into fist-sized batches and on a separate banana leaf or a sheet of aluminum foil, shape each batch into oblongs that are 2 inches wide and 12 inches long, then fold, so they are wrapped.', 'Arrange the chikwanga on a steamer placed over a pot of boiling water.

Italian Academy Of Cuisine'S Mandorlato Di Cologna Veneta With Cinnamon And Candied Citrus,"Mandorlato di Cologna Veneta is a member of a large dessert family called torrone or Italian nougat. Since mandorla means almond in Italian, its name clearly states that the almonds are the main ingredient, alongside honey and egg whites. Sugar, cinnamon, and candied citrus fruit may also be added, and the industrially prepared mandorlato can also contain aromas such as vanilla, and glucose syrup, which partially substitutes honey to lower the production costs. Mandorlato di Cologna Veneta usually comes in the form of long bars enveloped in ostia or cialde bianche — edible wafer paper, which prevents the bars from sticking. The texture is hard (duro) and brittle, and the mandorlato is consumed after it has been broken into small, bite-sized pieces. Its preparation starts with melting the honey in a bain-marie until it becomes completely liquid. The egg whites are beaten into firm snow, half of which is stirred into the melted honey. The mixture is then cooked for 20 to 30 minutes while stirring constantly. In the industrial preparation, the stirring can last for up to 8 hours and is done in specialized bain-marie mixers, which cook and stir the mixture simultaneously so that the mandorlato can achieve its recognizable brittle texture. In the next step, the other half of the egg whites is joined with the mixture, after which toasted almonds are added. A shallow baking pan or a special wooden mold is lined with wafer paper, and the mandorlato mixture is then poured in and left to cool slightly. When tepid, it is cut into pieces and then left to cool completely. Due to its high sugar content, the mandorlato can keep for months, especially if stored in an airtight container and kept in a cool place.","Cologna Veneta, Italy",3.4,"['750g (1 2/3 lbs) floral honey', '1 kg (2.2 lbs) almonds, peeled', '100g (3.5 oz) candied citrus, cut into cubes', '50g (1.75 oz) wafer paper', '1 pinch ground cinnamon', '2 egg whites']",8,10min,1h,1h 30min,2h 40min,TasteAtlas,"['Prepare a bain-marie and heat the honey for 30 minutes, stirring constantly.', 'Mix one egg white into a firm snow and stir it gently into the melted honey.', 'Reheat the bain-marie and cook this mixture for another 30 minutes.', 'Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.
