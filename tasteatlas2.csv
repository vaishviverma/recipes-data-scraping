Super Mission-Style Burrito,"Characterized by its whopping size, when compared to other types of burrito, mission burrito is made up of a tortilla filled with Mexican rice, beans, either carne asada (grilled and sliced beef), al pastor (spit-grilled pork), or offal, like beef tongue and beef brain, onions, cilantro, and salsa, either mild, just tomatoes and onions, or hot, with added jalapeños. The addition of sour cream, guacamole, and cheese turns the regular mission burrito into a ""super"" burrito. When done assembling the burrito, it is crucial to wrap it in tin foil as that helps hold it together. Although perfect on its own, it is a common practice to top the burrito with salsa in between each bite.","San Francisco, United States Of America",4.2,"['1 cup (180g) pinto or black beans, soaked overnight', '1 oz (30 ml) oil', '1/4 cup (25g) onion, minced', '1 garlic clove, minced', 'water, as needed', '1/4 bunch scallions, chopped', '1 tsp fresh thyme, chopped', 'salt and black pepper, to taste', '5 oz (150g) long-grain rice', '3 ripe avocados', '1 fresh plum tomato, diced small', '1 jalapeño pepper, seeded, minced', '1 tbsp cilantro, chopped', '1/2 red onion, diced small to equal 1/4 cup', '1 lime, juiced', 'salt, Tabasco, large grind black pepper, to taste', '6 plum tomatoes, seeded, medium dice', '1/4 cup (20g) onion, small dice', '1 jalapeño pepper, seeded, minced', '1 tbsp cilantro, chopped', '1 lime, juiced', 'salt, to taste', '1 lb (450g) skirt steak', '1/4 cup (30g) shredded Monterey jack cheese', 'rice and beans', 'guacamole', 'pico de gallo', '1 oz (30g) sour cream', '1/4 head iceberg lettuce, shredded', '4 flour tortillas (12-inch/30 cm)']",4 Servings,PREP 50min,COOK 1h 10min,RESTING 25min,READY IN 2h 25min,TasteAtlas,"['First, sauté the onions and garlic, then add the beans and pour in enough water so the beans are covered by an inch (2.5 cm).

Catania-Style Caponata,"With over 30 different recipes throughout Italy, this famous Sicilian vegetable relish can be easily tailored to match anyone’s taste. Traditionally, caponata is an eggplant-based dish prepared with the addition of tomatoes, peppers, capers, olives, onions, and celery. However, some recipes also call for the addition of pine nuts, almonds, raisins, or even artichokes or wild asparagus. After being sautéed one at a time, the vegetables are typically seasoned with sugar and left to simmer in vinegar, slowly melting into a tangy medley of sweet and sour flavors. Caponata can be enjoyed hot, although it is most often preserved for a few days after preparation and served as an antipasto course, either at room temperature or cold, which allows the flavors time to mellow and meld. Also, in some parts of Sicily, caponata is prepared with the addition of bitter dark chocolate — a common flavor enhancer left behind by the Spaniards that is present today in a number of traditional Sicilian recipes. To make caponata into an even more substantial dish, some recipes like caponata alla Catanese add potatoes to the mix, while the recipe for caponata Agrigentina features honey, lemon juice, and even seasonal fruit such as peaches or pears.","Sicily, Italy",4.6,"['800g (28 oz) eggplant, disgorged and diced beforehand', '400g (14 oz) green peppers, diced', '250g (8.8 oz) onion, julienned', '150g (5.3 oz) celery', '75g (2.5 oz) tomato concentrate', '100g (3.5 oz) green stoned olives', '25g (1 oz) capers', '40g (1.5 oz) pine nuts', '50g (1.8 oz) raisins', '100 ml (1/3 cup + 1 tbsp + 2 tsp) white wine vinegar', '100g (3.5 oz) sugar', 'extra-virgin olive oil, as needed', 'vegetable stock', 'salt, to taste', 'ground black pepper, to taste', 'basil leaves, to taste']",4 Servings,PREP 50min,COOK 30min,-,READY IN 1h 20min,TasteAtlas,"['For the sweet and sour sauce, brown the julienned onions, add sugar and salt.

Turon,"Turon is a Phillipino snack, often eaten for merienda, that consists of saba bananas rolled in sugar and pieces of jackfruit, enveloped in lumpia wrappers.

The lumpia wrappers are usually made just with salt, water, and flour, but if those are not readily available, spring roll wrappers can be used instead, although they are slightly thicker. The bananas are sliced in half lengthways, while jackfruit is sliced into strips.

Costoletta Alla Milanese,"Cotoletta alla Milanese, or Milanese veal cutlet, is a traditional Italian dish which originated in Lombardy, Northern Italy. The dish consists of a veal cutlet pounded thin, covered in breading and fried in butter. Veal Milanese is quite similar to the Austrian Wiener schnitzel, but they differ in some key points; first, the Milanese cutlet is dredged only in breadcrumbs, while its Viennese cousin gets covered in both breadcrumbs and flour; and second, cotoletta alla Milanese is fried in butter, whereas Wiener schnitzel is fried in lard. Also, a cotoletta alla Milanese differs from the costoletta alla Milanese, with the former being a flattened scallop, and the latter a bone-in rib chop. Even though the preparation processes do not differ, the bone-in version is a more authentic one. To prepare the dish, dip a pounded veal chop into a beaten egg, and then in breadcrumbs, and fry the veal chops in a lot of butter over moderately high heat. Although the dish is traditionally made with veal, other kinds of meat have become popular to use instead, like chicken or turkey. The poultry variations are especially popular in the USA and other English-speaking countries. Another variation of cotoletta alla Milanese is called orrechio d'elefante (it. the elephant ear). It is comprised of a thinner but a larger cut of boneless meat. Grated parmesan cheese is also sometimes added to the beaten egg or mixed with the breadcrumbs. Cotoletta alla Milanese, also known as fettina panata, is usually served with potatoes, mashed, fried or baked, or some vegetables. Lemon wedges are often served on the side too.","Milan, Italy",4.4,"['4 bone-in veal cutlets', '2 eggs', 'large ground breadcrumbs', '100 g butter', 'salt', '1 lemon']",4 Servings,PREP 15min,COOK 15min,-,READY IN 30min,TasteAtlas,"['After removing the membranes of the cutlets, flatten them with a tenderizer.', 'Beat the eggs in a bowl and dip the cutlets in, one at a time.

Baci Di Dama Di Tortona,"Baci di dama (lady’s kisses) is a traditional Italian cookie originating from Tortona, Piedmont. The dessert consists of two pastry caps joined together with a chocolate ganache layer, making it both crisp and fudgy. The cookie caps look like lips with an intent to kiss, hence the name lady’s kisses. Initially, this meltingly tender nut cookie was made with hazelnut flour, but recent adaptations of the recipe base the cookie dough on almond flour instead. Although the traditional recipe calls for a dark chocolate ganache, countless variations include white chocolate and fruit-based ganaches. Some of the best-known baci di dama variations suggest adding honey, cocoa, and flavorings such as vanilla sugar and orange zest to the cookie dough to make the dessert more fragrant.

Arequipa-Style Rocoto Relleno,"The Arequipa-style rocoto relleno recipe starts with thoroughly preparing the rocoto peppers. After cutting off their tops, they're meticulously boiled in salted water not once but three times in order to tame their spiciness. The peppers are filled with sautéed and minced pork and beef and a medley of ingredients like ají panca peppers, peanuts, hard-boiled eggs, olives, and raisins. The filled peppers are topped off with cheese and cut-off tops and baked, then served with baked potatoes topped with cheese. The Cusco-style rocoto relleno recipe is a similar concept executed a bit differently. The peppers are cut lengthways, and their spiciness tamed with lime-infused water.

Traditional Imeruli Khachapuri,"A dish many would consider Gregoria's national dish, Imeruli khachapuri is a type of bread with a cheese filling. What sets apart the Imeruli khachapuri from others in the khachapuri group, is its round shape. Typically, the dough is made with flour, water, milk, salt, and a leavening agent, either yeast or baking soda, but eggs, yogurt, buttermilk, and vinegar are often included as well. The filling is comprised of typically two kinds of cheese, the Sulguni, and the Imeretian cheese, but if Georgian cheese is not available, a mixture of mozzarella and feta in equal amounts is often used instead. The preparation starts with making the dough. The ingredients for the dough are mixed, then kneaded, and the dough is left to rise twice, the first rise is longer than the second. The cheese is grated and mixed, and if the mixture is falling apart, a small amount of egg is added, so it becomes compact. The dough is then shaped by hand into a circle and the cheese into a ball which is placed in the center of the dough. The sides of the dough are folded over the cheese and then sealed at the top. The khachapuri is then first flattened by hand and then rolled to the desired size. It can be baked either in the oven or in a pan on the stove. Optionally, when done, it can be brushed with butter. Imeruli khachapuri is served hot, cut up in wedges.","Imereti, Georgia",3.8,"['DOUGH', '200g (7 oz) all-purpose flour', '100g (3.5 oz) milk, lukewarm', 'approx. 50g (1.75 oz) water, depends on the flour', '4g (1 tsp) fresh yeast', '4g (1 tsp) salt', '8g (2 tsp) sunflower oil, for greasing', 'FILLING', '300g (10.5 oz) Imeruli cheese', '100g (3.5 oz) sulguni', '1 egg, if needed']",2 Servings,PREP 25min,COOK 10min,RESTING 8h,READY IN 8h 35min,TasteAtlas,"['Make the dough from flour, milk, water, and yeast.

Ensaïmada De Mallorca,"Ensaïmada is a Mallorcan coil-shaped pastry served with hefty amounts of powdered sugar.

Queso Helado,"Despite its name, ""cheese ice cream,"" queso helado is a cheese-free concoction. The traditional recipe is a blend of creamy milk infused with cinnamon, cloves, and coconut, sweetened with sugar, and enriched with egg yolks for a custard-like base. Once set in the freezer, it's served in squares dusted with ground cinnamon, making it a refreshing end to any meal. However, in the traditional preparation, a wooden barrel was used to house ice, sourced exclusively from nearby glaciers. Atop this icy bed, a metal pan was set. The creamy queso helado mixture was then poured in, and the pan was continuously rotated above the ice whilst also mixing the mixture, mimicking an inverted bain-marie technique. This method allowed the mixture to swiftly freeze against the chilled metal surface, after which it was expertly scraped off with a spatula or metal spoon.","Arequipa, Peru",4.4,"['1 1/3 L (5 1/2 cups) fresh whole milk', '150g (8.8 oz) sugar', '150g (8.8 oz) freshly grated coconut', '2 cinnamon sticks', '4 cloves', '4 egg yolks, well-beaten', '1 tsp ground cinnamon']",6 Servings,PREP 15min,COOK 25min,RESTING 1h,READY IN 1h 40min,TasteAtlas,"['Simmer the milk with cinnamon, cloves, and coconut for ten minutes on low heat, stirring occasionally.', 'Strain the mixture, stir in the sugar, and boil for two more minutes.', 'Next, whisk in the well-beaten egg yolks quickly to avoid any strands forming.', 'Take it off the heat and allow it to cool down.', 'Pour the mixture into containers and freeze for several hours.', 'Before serving, take it out of the freezer for a few minutes, cut into squares, and garnish with a sprinkle of ground cinnamon.']",https://www.tasteatlas.com/queso-helado/recipe,-

Original Nachos,"A popular snack that is enjoyed at sporting events, in bars over a cold drink, and as an appetizer, nachos can be prepared simply, quickly, and with just a few basic ingredients. The first building block is tortillas, preferably corn flour ones since their taste is more intense. They are cut into quarters which will each become a single triangle-shaped nacho. Next, tortilla triangles are either brushed with some oil and baked in an oven or under a broiler or fried shortly in a skillet in hot oil. After being cooled slightly, they are topped with grated longhorn cheese and a slice of pickled jalapeño pepper and baked again shortly, so the cheese melts. Nachos are often served with various dips such as sour cream, salsa, guacamole, and ranch dressing. The authentic nachos recipe evolved over time, so nowadays nachos can be prepared with virtually any topping imaginable. Most common suggestions include beans, small pieces of meat, or minced meat such as chili con carne, chorizo, or bacon, onions, cilantro, corn, olives, tomatoes, and there are even sweet nacho varieties with fruit, chocolate, cinnamon, and ice cream.","Piedras Negras, Mexico",4.1,"['3 corn tortillas', '1 cup (3 oz) (90g) shredded longhorn cheese', '1 tbsp canola oil', '12 pickled jalapeño slices']",3 Servings,PREP 5min,COOK 13min,-,READY IN 18min,TasteAtlas,"['Begin by preheating the oven to 350°F/180°C.', 'Apply oil to both sides on each tortilla using a brush.

Churros Madrileños,"The basic churro recipe is nothing more than flour, water, salt, and oil, while sugar is for dusting only. The preparation starts with making the dough. Flour is added to a pot of boiling water and mixed until the dough has formed. Once cooled, the dough is placed inside a special syringe called churrera that is fitted with a star-shaped nozzle. Next, the dough is pressed into the sizzling oil in either long, straight sticks, or into spirals or curls. While they are frying the churros will turn golden at which point they’re removed from the oil and placed on paper towels to drain. They are then cut up into smaller sticks, dusted with sugar, and served while still hot. These fried dough sticks are typically eaten for breakfast and are usually paired with either chocolate, dulce the leche, or coffee and milk, all three of which are intended for dunking, not drinking. Churros — sold predominantly in churrerías, specialized churros shops — are popular not only in Spain but across Latin America, as well as parts of United States. They can be plain, have various fillings, or be topped with different glazes. Depending on the region, these crispy treats will have a different preparation method and are known under various names. For example, porra is a bigger churro variety and is prepared with either yeast or baking powder, while tejeringos, which are native to Cádiz, Grenada, and Málaga are traditionally ring-shaped.","Spain, Europe",4.1,"['1 cup (120g) flour', '1 cup (240 ml) water', '1 tsp oil', 'a pinch of salt', 'olive oil', 'sugar']",6 Servings,PREP 15min,COOK 10min,RESTING 2h,READY IN 2h 25min,TasteAtlas,"['In a large saucepan boil water with salt and a tablespoon of oil, then immediately add the flour swiftly stirring until you have a smooth, thick mass.', 'Remove from heat, and allow to cool, then place inside a pastry bag fitted with a star-shaped nozzle.', 'Press the mass into the sizzling oil in the shape of a doughnut, and fry until golden.', 'Place on a paper towel to drain, sprinkle with sugar, and serve while still hot.']",https://www.tasteatlas.com/churros/recipe,https://www.tasteatlas.com/images/recipes/389840869dad4935bd6906f6f93cccd9.jpg?mw=910
Original Mama Ninfa’S Fajitas,"Like any other simple meat dish, fajitas rely heavily on the quality of its ingredients and skillful preparation. The main building block of this Tex-Mex classic is beef, specifically the tender and buttery skirt steak, which is marinated in a mixture of citrus and pineapple juice, soy sauce, chili powder, pepper, garlic, and aromatic spices, with an occasional addition of oil and brown sugar. The steak is then placed on a hot grill and cooked medium-rare to medium, so it remains juicy on the inside. After resting for 10 to 15 minutes, the meat is cut across the grain or diagonally into thin strips, and served with grilled, slightly charred strips of bell peppers and onion slices. A side of hot tortillas and condiments is brought to the table as well, and everyone assembles their own fajita.

The milkshake is made with milk and ice cream with the addition of flavored syrups and any other ingredients that may come to your mind — whipped cream, melted chocolate, caramel, butterscotch, chocolate chips, coffee, liquors, spices, crushed nuts. The texture depends heavily on the preparation: milkshakes prepared by hand in a traditional steel shaker tend to have a bit denser texture than the ones from an electric blender or a milkshake machine. Other than in the USA, milkshakes are popular in most English-speaking countries, where they are sometimes referred to as thick milkshakes or thick shakes, and in New England and Canada, the term frappe is used to differentiate the ice-cream based milkshake from the one without ice cream.

Red Miso Soup,"Served either as a breakfast or an appetizer, miso soup or misoshiru reflects the elegance of Japanese cuisine in its purest form.

Next, some miso paste — red, white, mixed, or other variations — is dissolved in some dashi. The mixture is then added to the rest of the dashi and brought to a simmering point. The next step is to include solid ingredients such as tofu, vegetables, algae, meat, fish or clams, which are put into the simmering soup until they are cooked or warmed.

Classic Grilled Cheese,"The basic recipe for this classic sandwich consists of nothing more than slices of American cheese tucked between two slices of buttered bread. The assembled sandwich is heated on both sides until the cheese melts and the bread becomes crispy and golden brown. Contemporary recipes will often substitute the tried and true American cheese with Swiss, cheddar, pepper jack, or provolone, and also add additional ingredients like avocados, tomatoes, onions, and peppers. There are several ways to prepare grilled cheese – the sandwich can be heated on a griddle, grilled, pan-fried, or toasted in a panini toaster. It is not uncommon for each part of the sandwich to be cooked separately and then assembled, or to coat the outsides of each slice of bread with grated cheese before cooking, a style known as the 'inside out' grilled cheese sandwich.

Traditional Spring Rolls,"Featured on each and every Chinese restaurant menu around the world, spring rolls are a versatile appetizer which should be brittle and crunchy on the outside, and tender and flavorful on the inside. They are a member of a large dim sum family, which includes small, bite-sized appetizers served in small baskets or plates, often with a dipping sauce. Generally, the filling for spring rolls is made with pork and/or seafood stir-fried with various vegetables, such as cabbage, carrots, mushrooms, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, and spring onions. Typically, the filling is marinated in or seasoned with soy sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, sesame oil, and rice wine. When it comes to wrappers, they can be made from rice or wheat flour and water, while egg may or may not be added to the dough. The filling is rolled inside a wrapper which is then sealed with a mixture of cornstarch and water, whisked egg or egg white.

Classic Pavlova,"Most commonly served in Australia and New Zealand as a part of Christmas dinner and for other festive occasions, pavlova — or the pav, as they tend to call it — requires simple yet fresh and quality ingredients and some skill for its preparation. The base of a pavlova is made with egg whites, caster sugar, cornflour, lemon juice, or other acids (such as vinegar or tartaric acid), and vanilla extract, which are mixed until peaks are formed. It is then baked at a low temperature to become crunchy on the outside and marshmallow-like on the inside and carefully cooled in a turned-off oven, with the door ajar. It is essential that the base of a pavlova does not get in touch with cool air at this point since that may cause it to drop. The dried and cooled base is covered with whipped cream and sliced fruit — the usual combination includes strawberries, bananas, kiwis, and passion fruit.","New Zealand, Australia And Oceania",4.5,"['6 egg whites', '10 tbsp sugar', '2 tsp vinegar', '1 tsp vanilla essence', 'whipped cream flavored with few drops of vanilla', 'fresh fruit (peaches, strawberries, lemon, passion fruit), finely chopped', 'OPTIONAL - MARSHMALLOW FILLING', '1 lb (450g) granulated sugar', '1 ½ cups (360 ml) of water', '1 oz (30g) powdered gelatine', '½ tsp tartaric acid', '2 egg whites', 'vanilla essence']",8 Servings,PREP 15min,COOK 45min,RESTING 5h,READY IN 6h,TasteAtlas,"['Beat the egg whites very stiff, then gently add sugar, vinegar, and vanilla essence.

Irish on the other hand will add in white pudding, Irish soda bread, and Irish potato cake. Traditionally, this dish also included things like bone marrow, pork crackling, and a huge pork chop, and baked beans were always homemade. Even though the eggs can be fried, scrambled or poached, the majority of the ingredients are fried; hence the dish is colloquially known as the fry-up.

The preparation starts with cooked short-grain rice, which can be prepared specifically for omurice or used from the day before. Then, finely chopped onions and other vegetables, such as carrots, cabbage, and peppers, are stir-fried in a skillet with some finely chopped chicken or other meat. The mixture is seasoned with salt, pepper, and tomato ketchup, and the cooked rice is then stirred in, so it absorbs all the flavors.

The Black Forest Cake,"Consisting of layers of chocolate sponge cake, whipped cream, and cherries soaked in kirsch brandy, the famous Black Forest cake (Schwarzwälder kirschtorte) is one of the best-known German desserts. A special type of cherry brandy from the Black Forest region, kirschwasser, is used to soak the cherries, moisten the layers of chocolate sponge cake, and flavor the whipped cream. The assembled cake is heavily decorated with the remaining whipped cream and chocolate shavings and is topped with fresh or candied cherries. Traditionally, however, the Black Forest cake may also have a base made of shortcrust pastry that acts not only as a base but also as a contrasting texture to the softness of the entire cake. Buttercream can sometimes be used instead of whipped cream or combined with it, while the sponge cake, either Génoise or Viennese sponge cake, can be baked in three or four tins or just in one and then cut up in layers.

Authentic Spanish Meat Migas,"Most national cuisines around the world have at least one traditional dish based almost entirely on leftovers, and Spain and Portugal are no exceptions to this rule. Their specialty is called migas, which translates as breadcrumbs, and it can be served as an appetizer, side dish or an individual meal for lunch or breakfast. The key ingredient for this dish is old, dry bread which is combined with oil or lard, garlic, salt, and paprika. Migas can often be enhanced with fresh or leftover meat, sausages, bacon, ham, fish, vegetables, eggs, or anything else from the pantry – there are even sweet versions of migas which include fruit, nuts, cinnamon, and chocolate. When it comes to preparation, it is rather simple: the bread is cut into slices or small pieces, or crumbled by hand, and soaked in slightly salted water — either overnight or until it becomes moist. Next, some oil or lard is heated on a frying pan, followed by garlic and paprika which give migas its distinctive taste. If migas is prepared with meat, it is tossed into the same frying pan, followed by water-soaked bread. Alternatively, the meat can be heated or sautéed and served on the side. All the ingredients are stirred constantly until the water evaporates, and the breadcrumbs become golden and crispy. Finally, the migas is served hot, most commonly in the same pan it was prepared in, or on a large plate, garnished with orange slices, grapes or meat.","Spain, Europe",4.6,"['500 g leftover bread', '150 g meat remaining from of a stew', '4 cloves garlic', '4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil', 'water', 'salt', '1 tbsp paprika']",4 Servings,PREP 5min,COOK 15min,-,READY IN 20min,TasteAtlas,"['To begin, cut the bread into slices, place them in a bowl and cover with water.

Classic Tahini Sauce,"The simplicity of preparation, widely available ingredients, plus virtually no fuss in the kitchen is what made tahini popular not just in Israel, but also worldwide. The word tahini — or tahina — may refer to two different things. The first one is a paste made with roasted sesame seeds, salt, and oil, which serves as a base for the namesake dip or sauce, in which tahini paste, garlic, water, and lemon juice are combined into a form of a purée. Tahini paste — also called raw tahini — is usually store-bought, but it can also be prepared at home in just a few minutes. Raw sesame seeds are roasted in an oven or on a skillet for 3 to 5 minutes until they start changing color, but they should not be allowed to become golden or brown. Next, they are ground into a paste with vegetable or olive oil, and a pinch of salt. The old-school way is to use a mortar and a pestle, but using a food processor will make the process quicker and easier. The main difference between the store-bought and the homemade tahini paste is that the store-bought kind is commonly made with hulled sesame seeds, which is why it tends to be smoother than the homemade one. To make tahini dip or sauce, garlic, water, and lemon juice are added to the tahini paste and mixed in a food processor until the desired consistency is reached. Amounts can be adjusted to taste, and tahini dip will keep well for 3 to 4 days if kept in an air-tight container in the refrigerator. Tahini sauce can be served as a spread on various types of flat bread or pita bread, used to prepare other spreads such as hummus or baba ghanoush, added in soups or utilized as a condiment for meat and fish dishes.","Syria, Asia",3.7,"['3/4 cup (200 g) raw tahini', '2 garlic cloves', '1/4 cup lemon juice (from 2 lemons)', '1/2 cup cold water']",4 Servings,PREP 10min,-,-,READY IN 10min,TasteAtlas,"['Place the raw tahini, garlic, lemon juice and water in a bowl of a food processor.', 'Pulse until you have reached a smooth consistency.', 'Adjust the amount of water, garlic and lemon juice to reach the texture and flavor you prefer.']",https://www.tasteatlas.com/tahini/recipe,https://www.tasteatlas.com/images/recipes/ee1e3891b56c44d5b993da88fb7a3c65.jpg?mw=910

Simple Oyakodon,"Belonging to a group of donburi dishes — which are made up of cooked or steamed rice that is topped with a range of cooked or fresh ingredients — oyakodon, also known as oyako-donburi, consists of a mixture of chicken meat, eggs, and onions served atop a bowl of rice. The preparation starts with combining the ubiquitous fish stock dashi with soy sauce, sugar, rice wine mirin, and rice liquor sake in a pan, and bringing them to a boil. Then, small pieces of the chicken thigh are added and cooked through. Adding finely sliced onion is mandatory, but the oyakodon may be enriched with other ingredients such as shiitake mushrooms, edamame, green beans, and leek. Then, a whisked egg is poured over the top and left to cook for 1 to 3 minutes. Finally, the mixture is gently slid over a bowl of freshly cooked or steamed rice, garnished with some chopped green onion or nori algae, and served.

Bellini,"A common find on the brunch menus today, Bellini is a classic cocktail made with two parts Prosecco and one part fresh peach purée. To prepare, the peach purée is poured into a chilled champagne flute first, followed by Prosecco, and the cocktail is then stirred gently, so the bubbles do not break. The original Bellini also included a small amount of raspberry or cherry juice which gave it a lovely pink glow. Variations on the original include a Puccini which has fresh mandarin juice in place of peach purée, a Rossini which is made with fresh strawberry purée, and Tintoretto, a cocktail made with fresh pomegranate juice.

Traditional Quiche Lorraine,"It is not surprising that quiche became one of those iconic dishes prepared worldwide: it is simple, versatile, and easy to make, and can be served both as an appetizer, a side dish, or a light brunch or dinner. The first step in preparing quiche Lorraine is deciding which type of pastry to use — available options are either shortcrust or puff pastry. Most modern recipes suggest using pre-made pastry, but you can also do it yourself if you have time. The pastry is rolled evenly with a rolling pin and then placed in a round baking tin with ruffled edges: it needs to cover both the bottom and the sides of the rolling tin, rising slightly above its edges. The pastry is then pierced with a fork, after which it can be pre-baked or filled and baked all together. Keeping it simple is a general rule for making the filling for quiche Lorraine: cream and eggs are whisked together and seasoned with salt, pepper, and, optionally, nutmeg. Diced and fried bacon is also an important part of the filling: you can sprinkle it on the bottom of the pastry before pouring in the custard or simply mix it in the custard. Finally, quiche Lorraine is baked and served warm, sliced in triangles. A side of fresh salad and a glass of chilled wine will complete the picture.","Lorraine, France",4.0,"['SHORTCRUST PASTRY', '200g (7 oz) flour', '100g (3.5 oz) butter', '1 pinch of salt', 'cold water, as needed', 'FILLING', '4 eggs', '200 ml (3/4 cup + 4 tsp) crème fraîche', '200g (7 oz) smoked bacon', 'pepper, as desired', 'nutmeg, as desired (optional)']",8 Servings,PREP 1h,COOK 30min,RESTING 30min,READY IN 2h,TasteAtlas,"['Place flour and salt into a large bowl, add the cubes of butter, and work the butter into the flour with your fingers until the mixture becomes breadcrumb-like.', 'Knead, adding cold water tablespoon by tablespoon to the flour and butter mixture just until it comes together into a smooth dough.', 'Wrap the ball of dough in cling film and refrigerate for 30 minutes.', 'Set the oven to preheat to 200°C/400°F.', 'Lightly flour your working surface, then place the ball of dough on the flour and roll it out to fit a 23 cm (9-inch) quiche pan, making sure you roll it out enough to cover the bottom and the sides of the pan.', 'Place the dough into a quiche pan, taking care it covers the bottom and the sides.

Basic Chawanmushi,"This Japanese custard is made with eggs, dashi, soy sauce, and mirin, plus numerous other ingredients like chicken, white fish, shrimp, shiitake mushrooms, kamaboko, gingko nuts, lily roots, carrots, Japanese parsley mitsuba, and many others. However, if udon noodles are added, the dish is not called chawanmushi but odamakimushi. The preparation begins with making the custard. The eggs are first whisked, then seasoned (typically) with dashi, mirin, and soy sauce. Then, to ensure the silkiest texture possible, the eggs are strained through a fine mesh sieve into another bowl. The other ingredients such as mushrooms, meat, fish, and vegetables are divided between cups, and the custard is then poured over. The cups are then covered with a lid or aluminum foil and either steamed or cooked in a water bath on low temperature anywhere from 15-30 minutes, depending on what ingredients were used. Chawanmushi is cooked when the edges have set, but the center is still slightly loose. If done to perfection, chawanmushi should ooze a clear broth when poked with a skewer. Unlike other Japanese dishes, chawanmushi is eaten with a spoon and not chopsticks. It is served either as an appetizer or a side dish, usually as a part of a traditional Japanese dinner called kaiseki-ryōri.","Kyoto, Japan",4.9,"['1 (5-inch) piece kombu', '2 tbsp bonito flakes', '1 1⁄2 tsp mirin', '1 1⁄2 tsp soy sauce', '3 large eggs']",4 Servings,PREP 15min,COOK 30min,-,READY IN 45min,TasteAtlas,"['First, set the oven to preheat to 325°F.', 'To make dashi, boil kombu with 1 ½ cups of water, then take off the stove, take out the kombu, and add bonito flakes.

For example, tostadas de tinga are topped with tinga, a dish of shredded meat (usually beef or chicken, but also pork), tomatoes, chile chipotle, onions, and garlic that is typically used as a garnish or as a filling. Tostadas de frijoles, on the other hand, are spread with refried beans and then topped with various ingredients. Tostada de pata de res which has a cow's feet topping is also well-known.

New York-Style Pizza,"Unlike Chicago-style deep-dish pizza, the essence of the New York-style pizza lies in its thin crust, which is elastic enough to be easily bent but firm enough to keep all the ingredients in place when eaten in slices. The process starts with preparing the dough, which can take up to 24 hours and relies on the feeling and experience rather than strict measures. Flour, sugar, salt, and yeast are combined with olive and water by hand or in a food processor until the dough is smooth and elastic. Since renowned New York pizza places prepare their dough in special dough-making machines, it is advised to use a food processor for home preparation to prevent the dough from over-oxidizing. The dough needs to rest in the refrigerator after the first kneading, and the general advice is to let it sit for at least 24 hours and up to 5 days before preparing the pizza itself. One hour before baking, the dough should be left to rise at room temperature and then stretched using the knuckles of your hand to form a circle 12 to 14 inches (30 cm to 35 cm) in diameter and 1/4-inch (0.6 cm) thick. The outer rim should stay slightly thicker than the center. Aromatic tomato sauce is spread evenly on the surface, followed by full-fat, grated, dry mozzarella cheese. The pizza is then baked for 12 to 15 minutes at a 500°F/260°C temperature or for mere 3 to 5 minutes in original pizza places that use old-school coal ovens. The pizza is done when the rim and the bottom are slightly browned, and the cheese has melted completely.

Classic Île Flottante,"Unlike most classic French desserts, île flottante or floating island is surprisingly simple to make and requires only basic culinary skills and ingredients. Its preparation can be divided into four steps: making the meringue, preparing the vanilla custard cream or crème Anglaise, cooking the caramel, and assembling. The meringue is prepared by mixing the egg whites, sugar, and a pinch of salt into a firm snow, and baking it shortly in the oven in a bain-marie. To make the vanilla custard, the milk with a scraped vanilla pod or some vanilla extract is slowly brought to a boil, while the egg yolks are beaten with sugar to become fluffy and pale yellow. The mixture of egg yolk and sugar is poured into the vanilla-flavored milk and cooked over low heat until it thickens. In a separate saucepan, sugar and water are boiled together until a caramel syrup is formed. Finally, there are two ways to serve and assemble the floating island. One way is to pour the vanilla custard into a large bowl, place the entire amount of the meringue on top in one piece, and drizzle it with caramel syrup. The bowl is brought to the table with a large ladle so that each person can adjust the meringue to custard ratio to their liking. Alternatively, the floating island can be served in individual ramekins — a ladle of custard is topped with a dollop of meringue and decorated with caramel. Some recipes, on the other hand, suggest coating the ramekins with caramel before pouring in the custard.

The Royal Society Of Chemistry Yorkshire Pudding,"Yorkshire pudding is a traditional English dish made with a simple batter of eggs, flour, milk, or water, and a pinch of salt. In order for the Yorkshire pudding to rise well during baking, the batter must be very light, fluffy, and airy, and the fat on the bottom of the baking tin must be extremely hot. According to the English Royal Society of Chemistry, a Yorkshire pudding isn’t a Yorkshire pudding if it is less than four inches tall. It is baked either in portions using separate smaller tins or in a large, shallow roasting tin, after which it is cut into squares for serving. The texture depends on the type of liquid used; a Yorkshire pudding made with more water will be crispier, whereas one made with extra milk will be richer and of a softer texture.","Yorkshire, England",4.3,"['4 1/2 tbsp of plain flour', '3 eggs', 'half milk, half water to make a thin batter', '1/4 tsp of salt', 'Beef dripping, as needed']",6 Servings,PREP 25min,COOK 15min,RESTING 10min,READY IN 50min,TasteAtlas,"['Set the oven to preheat to maximum temperature.

Pastiera,"This traditional Neapolitan delicacy is traditionally prepared for Easter, on Holy Thursday or Good Friday. However, it is prepared year-round nowadays and can be sampled in the city’s pasticcerias, shops selling pastries and cakes. Pastiera is a tart with a shortcrust pastry shell filled with a mixture of ricotta, sugar, grano cotto (cooked wheat), eggs, yolks, and candied fruits, flavored with orange blossom water and vanilla. Cinnamon is also common, but there are debates about whether or not it should be included, with purists claiming that a true pastiera does not contain cinnamon. Strips of shortcrust pastry dough are arranged on top of the pie, either in the shape of a Greek or a St. Andrew’s cross. Usually, seven strips are arranged on top of the pie, four strips are arranged first, and then three are placed on top of the first four. The finished pastriera should be left to rest for two days, so the flavors can develop, which is the reason it’s traditionally prepared two to three days before Easter.

Shredded cheese can be used as a filling, but it is more common to serve it on the side. The tortillas are filled and folded into a tight cylinder, and then deep-fried in oil.

Italian Academy Of Cuisine'S Saltimbocca Alla Romana,"Pan-fried veal cutlets wrapped in Italian prosciutto, flavored with fresh sage, and sautéed in white wine — it doesn't get more straightforward than that. The recipe itself doesn't require many ingredients, but if you want your saltiambocca to taste like the one from a Roman restaurant kitchen, the ingredients must be of top quality. To prepare the perfect saltimbocca alla Romana, your veal cutlets must be pounded very thin, making the meat extra tender. The prosciutto should be sliced paper-thin and used with the fat on, as this will lend even more flavor as the fat renders out during frying.

Traditional Chana Masala,"Although the list of ingredients for chana masala might seem exotic for someone outside India, this versatile dish is actually an everyday thing, and can be served as breakfast, main meal, light dinner or street food. Its texture can also vary — it can resemble soup, be as dense as a stew, or reduced to almost completely dry. Chana masala may be a vegetarian dish, but since it is legume-based, it is a rich source of protein. The main ingredient is the chickpeas, known as chana or chole in India, and two varieties are most commonly used: white, slightly bigger chickpeas, or the dark, smaller variety. Dried chickpeas are soaked in water overnight and cooked in a pressure cooker or in a regular pot, which lasts longer. They are often replaced with canned chickpeas: they do not need to be cooked, just washed out and set aside. Onion, garlic, and ginger — the latter two crushed into a paste — are sautéed in oil, after which a blend of spices is added. The regular list includes coriander, cumin, turmeric, chili and garam masala, a popular spice blend used for preparing numerous Indian dishes. A sliced green chili pepper is added to give extra spiciness to this dish, and its amounts can be adjusted according to taste. Next, comes the tomato purée made either from fresh or canned tomato, followed by pre-cooked chickpeas. The chana masala is then simmered for roughly 30 minutes, and water can be added to adjust the density of the dish. Garnished with some fresh coriander leaves, and served with rice or one of the many varieties of Indian flatbread like naan, roti, parantha and poori, chana masala is enjoyed hot and with a side of lassi – sweet or savory yogurt-based drink.","Gujarat, India",4.7,"['4 tbsp sunflower oil', '2 onions, chopped', '1 inch ginger, grated', '5 cloves garlic, grated', '3 cup tomatoes, chopped', '2 ½ tbsp coriander powder', '1 tsp powdered turmeric', '2 ½ tbsp cumin powder', '1 tsp powdered red chili', '2 ½ cups chickpeas, soaked overnight', '2 ½ cups water', '2 pinches powdered salt', '4 green chilies, sliced', '1 tsp garam masala powder', 'FOR GARNISHING', '1 handful coriander leaves, chopped']",4 Servings,PREP 15min,COOK 45min,-,READY IN 1h,TasteAtlas,"['To begin, take a large pan and heat the oil over medium flame.

Classic Biltong,"Similar to beef jerky in the USA, biltong is, without a doubt, the most popular meat snack in South Africa. Although its preparation method might seem simple or even primitive at first sight, it is actually a mélange of culinary knowledge and ingredients gathered across three continents — Africa, Europe, and Asia. The first step is to prepare the meat. Unlike the modern versions, which are most commonly based on quality cuts of beef, such as silverside or topside, the classic approach calls for game meat, while extravagant versions include ostrich or crocodile meat. The meat is cut into thin and long strips along the grain and seasoned with salt. After one hour, the salt is scraped off, and the meat is brushed with, or dipped into, vinegar whose purpose is to kill the potentially life-threatening bacteria. Sometimes, Worcestershire sauce and sugar are combined with the vinegar to achieve a richer flavor. Next, the meat is rubbed with a combination of spices — coriander and pepper are mandatory, while additional options include cloves, garlic, paprika, chili flakes, or a specialized store-bought blend simply called biltong spice. Hanging the meat and drying it is the next and final step — it can be done in a well-ventilated room, in an oven at low temperature, in a specialized homemade biltong box heated by a light bulb, or in more sophisticated biltong drying machines. The length of drying can vary from 3 to up to 7 days, depending on the desired texture — dry, moist, or in-between. After drying, biltong is kept in a refrigerator, or in a vacuum-sealed plastic wrap. As for serving, biltong is typically cut in thin slices or diced and offered as a snack, but it can become an ingredient of almost any dish, ranging from spreads, pâtés, salads, soups, and stews, to quiches and even pizza.","South Africa, Africa",4.1,"['beef (preferably silverside)', 'rock salt', 'coarse ground black pepper', 'coarse ground coriander', 'vinegar']",0 Serving,PREP 45min,-,RESTING 1h,READY IN 4d 1h,TasteAtlas,"['First, prepare the beef: cut 1/2-inch (1.25 cm) thick strips along the grain, and make each strip is around 6 inches (15.25 cm) long.', 'Season the meat with salt on each side.

Ricotta Crostata,"At it’s most basic, crostata consists of a filling — either fruits, custard, jam, or ricotta — enclosed in an Italian version of shortcrust pastry called pasta frolla. However, unlike the French tart and the American pie, the dough for the Italian crostata is made by kneading soft butter into the flour which gives it a cake-like texture.

Traditional Coq Au Vin,"Combining a rich dark sauce with flavorful onions, lardons, mushrooms, and tender browned pieces of rooster meat, coq au vin is a great make-ahead meal perfect for entertaining, as it can be simply reheated before serving. This crowd-pleaser also lends itself easily to large parties, as the recipe can be easily doubled or tripled. Coq au vin is even better the day after it is made, as all the ingredients will have had time to steep overnight. According to the traditional recipe, coq au vin is prepared using rooster meat which is gamey and tough when compared to younger chicken meat predominantly sold in stores today. The sauce is made with a whole bottle of red Burgundy wine, which is thickened with rooster's blood near the end of cooking. Mushrooms and onions are typically cooked separately and added either near the end of cooking or once the dish is cooked to avoid overcooking. Regional variations differ in the type of wine used. Even though both dishes often include morels and cream, coq au vin jaune from the Jura region is made with vin jaune, a type of white wine, while Riesling wine is the wine of choice for the Alsatian coq au Riesling. Coq au pourpre or coq au violet is made with Beaujolais nouveau wine which is produced from Gamay grapes, and there is even coq au Champagne from the namesake Champagne region.

Basic Bublanina,"Fresh, juicy summer fruits and berries enveloped in a soft sponge cake — that, in short, is bublanina, a typical Czech dessert which can also be found in Slovakia. This simple dessert is prepared by mixing wheat flour, sugar, eggs, butter or oil, and baking powder into a batter, which can also contain vanilla sugar or vanilla extract, lemon zest, and milk. The batter preparation method varies greatly from one recipe to another. For instance, all the ingredients can simply be mixed in one bowl; the more advanced recipes suggest mixing the dry ingredients first, and then adding the wet ones; while some call for whipping the egg whites into a firm snow, which is then folded into the batter to make it fluffier. The batter is poured into a greased baking pan dusted with flour, and the fruit — fresh, frozen, or canned — is arranged on top. Although some believe it is best to enjoy bublanina during summer, when there is an abundance of fresh, ripe fruit, frozen or canned varieties are a great substitute.

The preparation starts with sautéing onions and garlic in heated olive oil. Next step is to add crushed tomatoes and vodka, which are supposed to simmer until reduced by half. The heavy cream is then stirred in, which will give the sauce a bright orange color. The combination of tomatoes and cream is rarely seen in Italian cooking, because the acidity of the tomatoes may cause the oil from the cream to separate. Vodka – or its Italian relative, grappa – serves as an emulsifier which will keep the ingredients homogeneous. Meanwhile, the pasta – preferably penne, tubular-shaped pasta - is cooked in boiling salted water until they are al dente. Grated cheese such as parmesan can be mixed into the sauce or sprinkled on the finished dish. The pasta should be left simmering in the sauce for a couple of minutes before serving, and some recipes suggest adding bacon or sausages.","United States Of America, North America",4.4,"['1 can (35 oz) plum tomatoes with their liquid', '1 lb penne', '1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil', '10 cloves garlic, peeled', 'crushed hot red pepper', '1/4 cup vodka', '1/2 cup heavy cream', '2 tbsp unsalted butter or olive oil', '2-3 tbsp chopped fresh parsley', '3/4 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano', 'salt']",6 Servings,PREP 5min,COOK 20min,-,READY IN 25min,TasteAtlas,"['Boil 6 quarts of salted water in an 8-quart pot over high heat.', 'Put the tomatoes with their liquid in a food processor.

Le Petit Larousse'S Classic Crème Caramel,"Just like its kindred dish, crème brûlée, crème caramel is a showcase for the elegance of classic French cooking. Also known as flan or caramel pudding, this dessert is made of custard with a layer of soft, liquid caramel on top, while crème brûlée has a crispy caramel topping that needs to be broken down with a spoon. The preparation process starts by boiling whole milk with a scraped vanilla pod and sometimes even sugar. After the milk has cooled, the vanilla pod is removed, and the milk is boiled once again to lock the flavor. In the next stage, the custard is made by mixing sugar with whole eggs and egg yolks and pouring in the vanilla-flavored milk. The custard is then strained and set aside, and in the meantime, caramel is prepared by melting sugar in some water until it reaches 180°C/350°F and a golden-brown hue. A thin layer of hot caramel is poured in ramekins — small, single-portioned ones are most common — which are then filled with custard. Alternatively, one large ramekin can be used, but this is usually avoided due to the fact that the custard is quite sensitive and may fall apart during serving. Finally, the ramekins are placed in a bain-marie, or a water bath, and baked in an oven for three hours at a low temperature (around 150°C/300°F). The assembled dessert is cooled to room temperature and then refrigerated. Right before serving, the ramekins are turned upside down — hence the French term crème renversée — and the crème caramel is gently released, so the liquid caramel is on top. Variations are mainly based on enriching the custard with different ingredients, such are orange or lemon zest, rose water, lavender, spices (e.g., cinnamon), or even pieces of fruit.","France, Europe",5.0,"['1 L (4 cups + 3 tbsp) whole milk', '3 vanilla pods', '4 whole eggs', '3 egg yolks', '350g (1 ¾ cups) sugar (200g/1 cup for custard and 150g/3/4 cup for caramel)', '60 ml (1/4 cup) water']",4 Servings,PREP 25min,COOK 3h,RESTING 24h,READY IN 1d 3h,TasteAtlas,"['Split and scrape the vanilla pods, place them in milk and bring to boil.

Bobotie,"This South African casserole is made with either beef or lamb and is typically seasoned only with turmeric and curry; however, various recipes call for an array of spices, such as allspice, nutmeg, and cloves. Milk-soaked bread is added principally to provide moisture, although nowadays, pork is often added to the meat mixture for extra moisture and flavor. The recipe gets its sweetness from dried fruits and nuts, such as raisins, sultanas, almonds, and walnuts, as well as apples and dried apricots. Onions are first sautéed and then added to the remaining ingredients and baked. Some chefs choose to also sauté the meat together with the onions — in this case, the final baking time is shorter. Near the end of baking, the bobotie is coated with an egg and milk custard and decorated with either bay leaves, lemon leaves, or orange leaves, and occasionally also banana slices, almond slivers, and coconut shavings. Once baked, bobotie is usually served with a side of yellow rice, chutney, and sambal — a salad made by combining either cucumbers, onions, tomatoes, carrots, or apples that is typically chili-based.","South Africa, Africa",4.1,"['1 slice homemade-type white bread, 1 inch thick, broken into small bite-sized pieces', '1 cup (240 ml) milk', '2 tbsp butter', '2 lbs (1 kg) coarsely ground lean lamb', '1 ½ cups (180g) finely chopped onions', '2 tbsp curry powder, preferably Madras type', '1 tbsp light-brown sugar', '1 tsp salt', '½ tsp freshly ground black pepper', '¼ cup (60 ml) strained fresh lemon juice', '3 eggs', '1 medium-sized tart cooking apple, peeled, cored and finely grated', '½ cup (80g) seedless raisins', '¼ cup (30g) blanched almonds, coarsely chopped', '4 small fresh lemon or orange leaves, or substitute 4 small bay leaves']",6 Servings,PREP 35min,COOK 40min,RESTING 10min,READY IN 1h 25min,TasteAtlas,"['First, set the oven to preheat to 300°F/150°C.

Mrs. Goodfellow'S Lemon Meringue Pie,"Lemon meringue pie is one of the few desserts that have received international acclaim. The pie is composed of a shortcrust pastry base, a tangy lemon curd, and a fluffy meringue. It all starts with making and pre-baking the pie crust. Flour, salt, butter, and water are combined into a dough ball that is then flattened, covered with plastic wrap, and left in the refrigerator to rest. The dough is then rolled out into a circle, placed within a pie mold, lined with a piece of parchment paper topped with baking stones, and baked until golden brown. For the lemon filling, eggs, sugar, egg yolks, lemon juice, and lemon zest are whisked together and simmered over medium heat. Once thickened, cubed butter is stirred into the mixture until it melts completely. The lemon curd is then evenly distributed across the shortcrust pastry and left to cool in the refrigerator. Lastly, for the meringue, egg whites are mixed at medium speed until foamy. One tablespoon at a time, sugar is added to the egg whites, which are then whipped until stiff peaks start to form. The pie is then topped with the meringue and baked.","France, Europe",4.1,"['PIE CRUST', '1 2/3 cups (200 g) sifted all-purpose flour', '1/4 (1.5 g) tsp salt', '4 oz (115 g) cold unsalted butter, cubed', '4-5 tbsp ice water', 'LEMON FILLING', '3 large eggs', '7 large egg yolks', '3/4 cup (150 g) granulated sugar', 'zest of 2 lemons', '1 cup (240 mL) freshly squeezed lemon juice', '8 oz (230 g) cold unsalted butter, cubed', 'MERINGUE', '7 large egg whites', '1/4 cup (50 g) sugar']",8 Servings,PREP 2h,COOK 45min,-,READY IN 2h 45min,TasteAtlas,"['Start with preparing and pre-baking the pie crust.

Semla With Crunchy Almond Filling,"Mainly associated with Fat Tuesday, since in the past, it was the only day of the year when one could eat it, semla is the traditional Swedish dessert that has become so beloved, nowadays it's eaten from Christmastime all the way through Lent. The main components are a cardamom-spiced wheat bun, an almond filling, whipped cream, and powdered sugar. The dough for the buns is a yeasted, butter-rich dough that is shaped into buns, which can be glazed with an egg wash before baking, but that is not a must. The top of the bun is cut off, the crumbs are scooped out the bottom part of the bun, and the hollowed-out insides are filled with an almond filling. Swirls of whipped cream are piped on top and then covered with the cut-off bun top, which acts as a lid. Before serving, the dessert is dusted with powdered sugar. Still, serving semla in a bowl of warm milk is the traditional way of serving this dessert, in which case it's called hetvägg. Also, apart from Sweden, different versions of semla are eaten in different countries of Scandinavia. However, the difference is mainly in the filling. Raspberry or strawberry jam is often used instead of the almond filling, but the filling can be just whipped cream or pastry cream. Plus, in Denmark and Iceland, for example, buns are made with puff pastry.","Sweden, Europe",4.8,"['STARTER DOUGH', '50g (1.75 oz) fresh yeast', '240 ml (1 cup) whole milk, room temperature', '100g (1/2 cup) sugar', '350g (3 cups) all-purpose flour', 'SECOND DOUGH', '240 ml (1 cup) whole milk, room temperature', '150g (3/4 cup) sugar', '200g (3/4 cup + 2 tbsp) butter, cubed', '10g (2 tsp) salt', '750g (1 2/3 lbs) all-purpose flour', '1 egg', '1 tbsp freshly ground cardamom', 'ALMOND PASTE', '100g (3.5 oz) sweet almonds', '100g (1/2 cup) sugar', 'FILLING', '200g (7 oz) almond paste', '100g (3.5 oz) toasted almonds with peel, coarsely chopped', '50g (1/4 cup) sugar', '10g (2 tsp) vanilla powder', '1-2 grated bitter almonds or 1 tsp bitter almond oil', '50-100 ml (1/4 cup - 1/2 cup) whole milk (start with the smaller amount and add more if you need)', 'TO FINISH', 'whipped cream', 'powdered sugar, for dusting']",16 Servings,PREP 1h 30min,COOK 35min,RESTING 2h,READY IN 6h 35min,TasteAtlas,"['To make the starter, first, dissolve the yeast in warmed milk.

Authentic Pandoro,"Pandoro, or pan d’oro (lit. golden bread), is a classic Veronese sweet bread served in Italian households during the Christmas season. However, pandoro should not be mistaken with panettone, a similar sweet bread containing raisins and various candied citrus fruit. Pandoro is a beautifully elegant dessert made with wheat flour, mother yeast, sugar, category A fresh chicken eggs, butter, salt, and vanilla. Apart from its silky smooth texture and golden crust, what makes pandoro stand out is its eight-pointed star shape. When dusted with icing sugar, one could easily see the resemblance between pandoro and the Italian Alps’ snowy peaks. Although the ingredients necessary to make pandoro are basic, the process is relatively time-consuming and arduous. A traditionally made pandoro will have had three proofing stages, which means it takes more than thirty hours to make. First, a starter dough is made by repeatedly refreshing the mother yeast with flour and water, leaving the yeast to rise after each new addition. The starter dough is then combined with water, sugar, butter, egg yolks, and flour, creating the first dough that is left to rise for 12-16 hours. Once the first dough has had time to proof, the second dough is made following the same procedure. This time, powdered milk, white chocolate, and aromatic emulsion (made by combining butter, orange zest, honey, and vanilla) are added to the dough. After the second dough has had 40 minutes of proofing, it is twisted and left to rise for 30 more minutes. The twisting is repeated once again, and then the dough is transferred into a traditional, high-sided pandoro mold, where it is left to rise for 4-6 hours at room temperature. The sweet bread is then baked for 40-50 minutes until its inner temperature reaches 204°F/96°C. Once cooled, the pandoro is dusted with powdered sugar. Recent adaptations include filling the pandoro with custard, cream, liquor or serving it with melted chocolate. To pandoro is often sliced horizontally to achieve a more festive look, with the resulting slices assembled in a shape resembling a Christmas tree.","Verona, Italy",4.5,"['3.5 oz (100g) mother yeast/lievito madre', '450g (1 lb) flour', '275 ml (9.3 oz) water', '4.4 oz (125g) of mother yeast', '2 cups (245g) of flour for pandoro/panettone type 00 or strong flour (manitoba) with at least W380 / 14% - 15% protein', '3 oz (90 ml) of water', '6 ½ tbsp (80g) granulated sugar', '3 oz (85g) cold egg yolks', '½ cup (117g) Ocelli or high-quality butter, room temperature', 'a pinch of salt', '1 cup (120g) flour for Pandoro / Panettone type 00 or strong flour (Manitoba) with at least W380 / 14% - 15% protein', '1 tsp (3g) malt', '1.3 oz (40 ml) water', '2 tbsp (30g) granulated sugar', '4.1 oz (90g) cold egg yolks', '½ cup (117g) high-quality butter at room temperature', '0.25 oz (7.5g) excellent quality white chocolate', '2 tsp (10g) powdered milk (skim or whole)', '1 tbsp (15g) aromatic emulsion', 'a pinch of salt', 'AROMATIC EMULSION', '2 tsp (10g) high-quality butter', '2 tsp (10g) honey', 'seeds of 1 Bourbon vanilla bean', 'grated orange zest']",8 Servings,PREP 1h,COOK 2h,RESTING 2d 10h,READY IN 2d 13h,TasteAtlas,"['The evening before you start preparing the pandoro, after having refreshed the mother yeast for a whole week, mix 3.5 oz (100g) of mother yeast, 7 oz (200g) of flour, and 3.4 oz (100 ml) of water together.

Eton Mess,"Refreshing and delicious, yet so simple to make, Eton Mess is a traditional British dessert known worldwide. Around for over a century, the dessert has seen many variations; however, the traditional recipe remains fairly uncomplicated. The treat is made out of strawberries, whipped cream, egg whites, and sugar. Egg whites and sugar are mixed together in a bowl, then dropped in even amounts onto a baking tray. Once baked, the meringue has to cool down completely, preferably overnight, before it is ready to be broken into smaller pieces. Strawberries are washed, hulled, and chopped, then, together with the meringue, folded into whipped cream. There are numerous variations on the original recipe, including the use of different types of fruit (blueberries, pomegranate, passion fruit, oranges, and more) and flavorings, such as chocolate, rosewater, and mint. The treat is usually served in glass serving cups or a bigger serving dish.","Eton, England",4.6,"['2 large egg whites', '120 g caster sugar', '500 g strawberries, hulled and roughly chopped', '450 ml double cream', '1 tbsp icing sugar']",6 Servings,PREP 20min,COOK 1h 15min,-,READY IN 1h 35min,TasteAtlas,"['Beat the egg whites in a large mixing bowl until stiff peaks are formed.

Auguste Escoffier'S Classic Sauce Velouté,"A true classic of French cuisine, sauce velouté is a velvety concoction of veal, chicken, or fish stock and roux — melted butter thickened with flour. Although it may seem simple at first glance, its preparation is quite time-consuming, and, when done right, employs a number of culinary techniques. The preparation starts with making the stock. Fresh bones are broken into pieces and simmered in water. Although roasting the bones is more than welcomed in the preparation of some stocks and soups, in this case, it should be avoided. During the lengthy cooking process, which can take up to 5 hours, the fat and the impurities must be skimmed off the surface regularly, in order for the stock reach its clear texture. Meat, carrots, onions, leeks, and herbs are added in the next step, and the stock is simmered for an additional 3 hours. It is then strained and set aside to cool slightly while moving on to the following chapter — the roux. Butter and flour are combined in a saucepan over low to medium heat, and their function is to thicken the sauce. The next step is quite delicate: the stock is poured into the roux, and to avoid lumps the mixture needs to be stirred constantly. At this point, the velouté can be seasoned with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. A small portion of mushroom skins and trimmings may also be added to enrich the taste. The sauce is simmered gently for 1,5 hours after which if it is strained, and cooked for an additional 30 minutes. Once again, the velouté is strained through a muslin cloth, so it becomes smooth and velvety, and is cooled by being stirred gently. At this moment the sauce can be served with meat, chicken, or fish, or used as a base for other sauces, such as sauce Suprême, Allemande, Bercy, and others. Sauce velouté is sometimes confused with béchamel because they both have white roux as a building block. However, the main difference is that velouté uses stock, while béchamel uses milk, and that velouté is slightly darker than the béchamel.","France, Europe",4.3,"['FOR WHITE VEAL STOCK', '10 lbs veal shin', '7 qt cold water', '15 oz carrots', '7,5 oz onions, stuck with a clove', '5 oz leeks, strung with a stick of celery', '1 bunch fresh herbs (1,25 oz parsley, 1 bay leaf, 1 spring thyme)', 'FOR PALE ROUX', '8 oz clarified butter', '9 oz flour', 'FOR 4 QT SAUCE VELOUTÉ', '1 lb pale roux', '5 qt white veal stock', '1 oz salt', '1 pinch nutmeg', 'white pepper, to taste', '1/4 lb white mushrooms’ skins and trimmings (optional)']",16 Servings,PREP 48min,COOK 2h 10min,-,READY IN 2h 58min,TasteAtlas,"['Start by preparing the white veal stock.

Qatayef I,"One of the most recognizable Ramadan sweets, qatyef is a stuffed pancake that is either fried or baked, but can also be left uncooked after it’s been stuffed. However, unlike regular pancakes, Arabic pancake qatyef is only baked on one side, which leaves the other side bubbly and soft, perfect for soaking up the delicious filling. The traditional fillings include sweetened clotted cream eshta, nuts like pistachio, hazelnuts, or pine nuts, while savory qatayef is usually filled with cheese, or left plain and served with soups. The basic batter for the pancakes is made with only flour, yeast, baking powder, salt, and water, but older recipes will also include semolina flour. Milk, whole wheat flour, sugar, oil, and various flavorings such as orange blossom water or rosewater are also common in recipes. Once filled, then baked or fried, qatayef is either dipped in or drizzled with syrup. Depending on their size, qatayef can be classified into three categories — regular, mini, and giant. The mini qatayf or qatayef asafiri is filled with clotted cream eshta and then dipped into ground pistachios, but unlike regular qatayef, it is not baked nor fried.

Classic Gallo Pinto,"As a dish invented to salvage the leftovers from the day before — namely, black beans and rice — gallo pinto barely needs a recipe, if you ask the Costa Ricans. If you decide to make it from scratch, note that the first step is soaking the dried beans overnight: this will soften their skin and shorten the cooking time. The beans are then cooked on medium heat for about three hours or until tender, and a small amount of water they were cooked in needs to be set aside. Next step is to fry the rice in some vegetable oil, and sauté it with some finely chopped onions and bell peppers: some recipes even suggest adding minced ham or sausage to this mixture. The rice and vegetables are then cooked in chicken broth or water until they become tender. Finally, some of the water the beans were cooked in is added to give the dish its specific color, and all the ingredients are sautéed once again. If pre-cooked beans and rice are used, it is enough to sauté them with vegetables in some vegetable oil. Gallo pinto is most commonly served for breakfast — the Costa Ricans pair it with coffee — but is also a common sight during lunch or dinner. The dish is so popular that it can be found virtually everywhere — from upscale hotels to fast-food chains such as Burger King. Local variants either omit the peppers (in Guanacaste province) or add some shredded coconut (on the Caribbean side of Costa Rica). One last thing that should be mentioned is Salsa Lizano, a store-bought sour-sweet condiment, which is served with almost every meal in Costa Rica, and gallo pinto is no exception.","Costa Rica, Central America",4.9,"['1 lb (450 g) black beans (fresh or dried)', '8-10 sprigs cilantro (fresh or frozen, not dried)', '1 small or medium onion', '1/2 small red or yellow sweet pepper (optional)', '3 cups (700 ml) chicken broth or water', '2 cups (350 ml) white rice', '1/2 tsp salt', '1 tbsp vegetable oil (for frying the rice)', '1-3 tbsp oil (for frying the gallo pinto)']",4 Servings,PREP 10min,COOK 3h 50min,-,READY IN 4h,TasteAtlas,"['If you use dried beans for this recipe, soak them in water overnight.

Traditional Hasselbackspotatis,"Hasselbackspotatis – known as hasselback potatoes outside their country of origin – are a famous Swedish interpretation of roasted potatoes. The main feature that makes Hasselbackspotatis stand out — both visually and in terms of texture — is their unique way of preparation: the potatoes are cut into thin slices almost all the way through. This leaves the slices anchored at the bottom of the potato while they sprawl at the top, resembling the shape of an open accordion. The roasted potatoes' layered appearance brings a dose of exclusivity and new aspects to the texture of a usually predictable ingredient: the deep cuts result in a crispy crust on the outside, contrasted by the soft, tender insides of the potato. Traditionally, Hasselbackspotatis are salted, coated with butter, and covered with breadcrumbs. However, their unique shape and formula lend themselves well to endless variations and decorations. Some variations include stuffing the separations between slices with bacon, salami, or varieties of cheese, adding various garnishes (pepper, rosemary, thyme, parsley, garlic, grated parmesan), as well as a variety of sauces. In its traditional form, hasselbackspotatis is a fulfilling side dish to beef steaks and other hearty meals. Still, some of its more substantially enriched variations can be served as the main course, ideally accompanied by various salads.","Stockholm, Sweden",4.1,"['1 kg (2.2 lbs) potatoes', '50g (1.75 oz) butter', '15g (1 tbsp) flake salt', '15g (1 tbsp) breadcrumbs']",4 Servings,PREP 15min,COOK 45min,-,READY IN 1h,TasteAtlas,"['Preheat the oven to 225°C (around 435°F).', 'Melt the butter in a saucepan until it turns golden.', 'Peel the potatoes, and then cut them into thin slices.

There are several versions of the dish, including the traditional quiche Lorraine, quiche Florentine, quiche au fromage, and quiche aux champignons. Plenty of other ingredients, such as tomatoes, kale, potatoes, leek, broccoli, asparagus, arugula, salmon, and chicken, also make for great quiche fillings. Quiche makes for a great brunch, lunch, or a light dinner.

Doughnuts,"According to The Oxford Companion to Food, a doughnut is a ""deep-fried ball or ring of soft dough"". The dough is typically yeast-risen and is made with flour, butter, eggs, sugar, milk, and salt, often flavored with vanilla. Alternatively, there is also a cake dough version which is leavened instead with baking powder. Most typically, the dough is shaped into rings by either cutting it out of the dough with a doughnut or a cookie cutter or by gluing the ends of a long and thin rolled piece of dough, which is the less often used method of the two. Besides the ring-shaped doughnut, another popular doughnut type is the filled doughnut which has a filling injected directly into its center after baking. Other popular shapes include Long Johns, dutchies, doughnut holes, and twists, often referred to as crullers. The shaped doughnuts are fried in hot oil, and then can either be sprinkled with regular of powdered sugar or spread with various glazes and icings, and topped with sprinkles, fruits, coconut, or chopped nuts.","United States Of America, North America",4.2,"['1 tbs plus 1 tsp active dry yeast', '1 cup (240 ml) whole milk, heated to 110°F/43°C', '2 to 2 ½ cups (320 to 400g) bread flour', '1 tsp pure vanilla extract', '3 large egg yolks', '2 tbsp superfine sugar', '1/2 tsp table salt', '4 tbsp (1/2 stick or 2 oz) unsalted butter, softened at room temperature, and cut into cubes', 'vegetable oil, for frying', 'BASIC SUGAR GLAZE', ""1/2 cup (100g) confectioners' sugar, sifted to remove any lumps"", '3 to 4 tbsp milk or water', '2 tsp vanilla extract (optional)', 'CHOCOLATE GLAZE', ""1 ½ cups (150g) confectioners' sugar"", '4 tbsp cocoa powder', '4-6 tbsp milk or water', '2 tsp vanilla']",12 Servings,PREP 1h,COOK 25min,RESTING 13h 50min,READY IN 15h 15min,TasteAtlas,"['Dissolve one tablespoon of yeast in a ¾ cup (180 ml) of warm milk, then add ¾ cup (120g) of flour and mix until you have a smooth paste.

Fish And Chips,"The national dish of Great Britain, fish and chips is one of the country's favorite takeaway meals, and it's incredibly easy to prepare at home. The traditional recipe calls for fillets of cod or haddock that are first evenly coated in a batter made of just flour, water, and baking soda and then fried in beef dripping or lard, while potatoes, which are cut somewhat thicker than regular French fries, are double fried to make them crispier. For serving, fish and chips are just sprinkled with salt and vinegar and are typically plated with a side of mushy peas. Variations on the recipe include using sparkling water or beer instead of tap water, adding milk or eggs to the batter or frying the fish and potatoes in vegetable oil instead of lard.

Larousse Gastronomique'S Macarons Ordinaire,"One of the world's best-known confections, macarons are notoriously difficult to make. While most recipes follow the same procedure as outlined here, slight variations do exist, most of which involve the way the meringue is prepared. Macarons made with French meringue have a crispier shell and an airier texture, while those made with Italian meringue have a soft shell and chewy interior. Almond flour is combined in a mixture with icing sugar, which then is carefully folded into the meringue. The resulting batter is spooned into a piping bag and piped into rounds onto a baking tray, taking care to make sure each round has enough space to expand during baking. Once the baking tray has been filled, it is lightly tapped to ensure any unwanted air is released from the macarons, after which they are left to rest and form a skin. Macarons are baked quite briefly, for about 15 minutes, and left to completely cool. They are then assembled by sandwiching the desired filling — typically buttercream, ganache, or jam — between two macaron rounds, and should then be chilled for 12 to 24 hours for the flavors and textures to gel. Various flavor and color combinations of both macaron rounds and fillings exist today, from more traditional ones like chocolate, raspberry, and vanilla, to more daring ones like matcha and foie gras.","Paris, France",4.3,"['200g (7 oz) almonds, blanched', '300g (10.5 oz) sugar', '2 egg whites, plus 1/2 egg white, optional', ""confectioners' sugar, as needed""]",3 Servings,PREP 30min,COOK 20min,RESTING 30min,READY IN 1h 20min,TasteAtlas,"['First, set the oven to preheat to 180°C/350°F, grind the blanched almonds until they turn almost powderlike (once ground, sift them to remove any lumps), and line two baking trays with parchment paper.', 'In a large bowl, combine together the sugar and the almonds, then fold in the two egg whites.', 'Using a mixer, whisk the mixture until it turns smooth.

Pretzels,"A pretzel is a baked snack prepared with a dough usually comprised of flour, yeast, sugar, butter, and water that is twisted into a specific pretzel knot. The preparation starts by gathering all the ingredients for the dough, then mixing and kneading them until a smooth dough is obtained, which is then divided into chunks that are rolled out and shaped into pretzels. Formed pastries are often dipped in lye (laugenbrezeln) or a baking soda bath, then sprinkled with some salt, and baked in the oven until brown. Besides salt, they can be topped with sugar, chocolate, cheese, cinnamon, nuts, and seeds. Numerous versions of the dish co-exist throughout Germany. In the region of Franconia, this pastry is often purchased sliced crosswise and coated in butter, or topped with some cheese or lunch meats. Swabian pretzels are thinner at the ends and have a high content of fat, while the Bavarian kind remains evenly thick throughout and incorporates a small amount of fat. In some parts of the country, sweetish New Year's pretzels are exchanged on January the 1st. Some other modifications of the dish include unglazed, pudding, and anise-flavored versions. The traditional, soft kind should be eaten in the hours following the preparation, while hard-baked ones, an American invention, will stay fresh longer.

Traditional Apple Pie,"Even though every American probably has their favorite way to make apple pie, the traditional apple pie is a double-crust pie, with a filling of thin slices of apples, sugar, a small amount of flour, bits of butter, and spices such as cinnamon in the middle. Alternatively, the filling can be precooked to prevent a soggy crust and to intensify the flavors and can include additional spices such as allspice, nutmeg, and lemon juice. Also, some recipes call for tapioca or cornstarch instead of flour to thicken the filling. If the pie does not have a decorative latticework top, is essential to make vents in the top crust so that steam can escape during baking.

American Pancakes,"A stack of fluffy pancakes drizzled with butter and maple syrup is a favorite way to start a day for many Americans, especially on weekends when one has more free time on its hands.

The preparation, which takes no more than a few minutes, is incredibly simple, as you just add wet ingredients to dry ones and whisk until you have a thick batter. Portions of the batter are dropped onto a greased and heated skillet into disks that are 4-inches (10 cm) wide. Once bubbles appear on the surface of the pancake, it is carefully flipped and cooked for another minute or two, then transferred onto a plate. The basic recipe can be enriched by incorporating additional ingredients like blueberries and chocolate.

The dry and wet ingredients are then combined gently, followed by nuts and other additions such as raisins, seeds or spices.

The Original Buffalo Wings,"Although chicken wings were long marked as the least desirable part of the chicken, the Buffalo wings recipe turned them into a juicy, spicy treat perfect for a snack or an appetizer, especially during sports events. This simple dish is prepared by first separating the chicken wings at the joint into a drumstick and a flat. Then, the wings are deep-fried or baked in a hot oven until they turn golden brown and crispy. Originally, the wings are left unseasoned and uncoated with flour, although some recipe variations suggest doing so. The following step is to toss the wings into a hot sauce with some melted butter or margarine — or, even better, into special Anchor Bar Wing Sauce which is the authentic ingredient.

Traditional Scottish Griddle Scones,"Depending on where one might find themselves in the British Isles, scones in all their varieties can be seen as a staple treat. Either as a delicious, buttery dessert to accompany a cup of afternoon tea, an addition to a wholesome breakfast, or a quick nibble in a coffee shop. Also known as griddle cakes or bannocks in Scotland, traditional scones were made with oats, sugar, salt, milk, and butter as primary ingredients and baked on hot griddles. Later on, flour was introduced as a standard and traditionally legitimate stand-in for oats. Also, nowadays, most scones are baked in the oven. Depending on the variety, scones can be savory or sweet, containing dried fruits, lemon curd, honey, clotted cream, or different jams. Some of the most famous Scottish varieties of scones are drop scone (also known as Scotch pancakes, based on a batter-like mixture baked on a griddle/girdle) and tattie scone (or potato scone, with mashed potatoes added to the mix).

Ma'Amoul,"These shortbread cookies popular in Levantine countries can traditionally have one of three possible fillings: date, walnut, and pistachio. For easier identification, the cookies will be shaped differently according to the filling that's hiding inside.

The dough, which contains no sugar, is made with semolina flour, ghee, and yeast, and perfumed with rose and orange blossom water. Flattened oblongs or balls of dough are then shaped and decorated using tabbeh — a traditional wooden mold used to make ma’amouls — arranged on a baking tray, and baked about 20-30 minutes, taking care not to overbake because the top of the cookie must remain pale.

However, the fillings and toppings may also include chorizo sausages, chilies, potatoes, mushrooms, refried beans, cilantro, and shredded lettuce. The first step when making chalupas is kneading a masa dough made with masa harina (a special kind of flour made of nixtamalized corn), some water, and salt. The dough is then divided and formed into small tortillas up to 10 cm in diameter, or into forms which resemble canoes. After being cooked in a comal, a cast-iron griddle, the tortillas are fried in lard to get a crunchy texture.

Paska will usually have less butter, may include sour cream, and can be enriched with vanilla, ginger, rum, sultanas, lemon peel, or saffron, but many recipes exclude dried fruits, rum, and peels altogether. The dough is baked in a round baking pan, and the top is ornately decorated with decorative dough shapes — crosses, braids, suns, fertility symbols, etc. The dough is typically glazed with an egg wash before it's baked. Alternatively, paska may not include dough ornaments and is coated instead with a white glaze and topped with sprinkles. Kulich, on the other hand, will be more buttery, airy, and will include more additional ingredients such as raisins, sultanas, almonds, and saffron. The raisins are usually rehydrated in rum which is also added to the dough. The dough is placed in either smaller or larger tins, depending on the preference. The still hot kulich is brushed with a glaze made with either powdered sugar and lemon juice, or a mixture of powdered sugar, lemon juice, and an egg white. Before the glaze has had time to set, it is usually topped with sprinkles or slivered almonds. The top of kulich is often adorned with the letters XB, meaning Христос воскрес (lit. Christ is risen). For serving, paska is paired with a custard-like cheese hrudka and is typically eaten with kovbasa or Eastern ham, while Kulich is traditionally served with a sweet cheese spread paskha.","Ukraine, Europe",4.7,"['1 ½ cups (360 ml) milk', '1/2 tps sugar', '1/2 cup (100g) sugar', '1/2 cup (120 ml) water (lukewarm)', '1 package yeast (active dry)', '7 ½ cups (900g) flour (all-purpose)', '3 large eggs (room-temperature, beaten)', '1/3 cup (75g) butter (melted)', '1 ½ tsp salt', 'FOR THE GLAZE', '1 large egg (room-temperature)']",12 Servings,PREP 20min,COOK 55min,RESTING 5h 10min,READY IN 6h 25min,TasteAtlas,"['Heat milk over medium heat and remove it from the stove just as it’s about to start boiling.

Cozonac,"The traditional Romanian, Bulgarian, and Moldavian sweet bread, cozonac (or kozunak in Bulgaria), is typically prepared for festive occasions — in Bulgaria, it’s mainly prepared exclusively for Easter, while in Romania, it’s prepared for both Easter and Christmas. In Romania, cozonac is made with enriched, yeasted dough that is often flavored with either orange peel, lemon peel, and/or vanilla, and has a filling of any of the following: walnuts, rahat, raisins, and cocoa. However, the Bulgarian version is more on the plain side, as it often doesn’t have a filling at all, or it has a much simpler one.

First, the rice flour is dissolved in some milk, then the rest of the milk is brought to a boil, and the mixture of rice flour and milk is then stirred into the hot milk. At this point, the heat is set to low, and the mixture is constantly stirred until thickened, about 15-20 minutes. The sugar and the flavorings are added at the end. When slightly cooled, the mehalabiya is poured into a large glass dish, or into individual bowls or glasses.

Belev Pastila,"Pastila is a traditional Russian fruit confectionery made with apples, sugar, and egg whites (optional). Simplicity at its finest, this natural fruit-based candy takes little effort to make. It is also one of the healthier desserts since it is naturally gluten-free, low in calories, and rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Additionally, if egg whites are excluded, pastila can be vegan as well. Traditionally, pastila is made with Antonov apples, an acidic sort that grows only in Russia. However, newer adaptations of the recipe include other types of fruits, such as pears, plums, apricots, currants, rowan berries, and lingonberries, and condiments like cinnamon and vanilla sugar that add more richness to the flavor. Lately, a vegetable-based pastila has also gained popularity. When it comes to the ingredients, pastila recipes significantly diverge, but preparation methods largely remain the same. The more traditional practice calls for drying the apple purée above 50°C/120°F, whereas the second method proposes drying the purée at a temperature below 50°C/120°F. Due to its spongy texture, pastila is often compared with marshmallow or zefir, although its texture is somewhat airier and lighter. Pastila can be bought in virtually every store in Russia, but making a batch at home is a worthwhile endeavor, mainly because it is not a particularly technical dish to pull off. What it does require, however, is a fair share of time and patience. Pastila needs about 10 hours to set and get dry. After it has been dried, it can either be served or stored in an airtight container in which it can last for months.","Kolomna, Russia",4.1,"['3 kg (6.6 lbs) Antonov apples (or any acidic sort)', '400g (2 cups) sugar', '4 egg whites', 'icing sugar, as needed']",10 Servings,PREP 1h,COOK 13h,-,READY IN 14h,TasteAtlas,"['Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F.', 'Wash, dry, and peel the apples.

The Original Italian Beef,"Shavings of simmered roast beef tucked in a long Italian roll, and served a jus, meaning with gravy — that, in short, is Italian beef, a sandwich native to Chicago. The preparation starts with wet roasting a hunk of beef which is rubbed in aromatics like garlic, oregano, and red pepper flakes. When the meat is done it is refrigerated together with the filtered broth overnight — some recipes even suggest freezing the meat for easier slicing. The following day, the broth is simmered until reduced, and the meat is sliced thinly, against the grain, then placed in the broth to heat through and soften some more. Italian or French bread roll —most commonly Turano or Gonnella French roll — is sliced open on one side, and stuffed with heaps of beef slices, and topped with sautéed green Italian sweet peppers and Chicago-style giardiniera, a spicy vegetable relish.

Mofongo,"Green plantain, pork cracklings chicharrón, garlic, and salt is all you need to make mofongo. However, there is, thankfully, more than one way to make it. Often, olive oil or chicken broth is added to moisten the mixture a bit, and sometimes a ripe plantain is used instead of a green one, while the use of either cassava, taro, eddoe, breadfruit, or a mixture of plantains and cassava instead of plantains is also quite widespread. Also, mofongo can have a seafood or a meat filling — alternatively, these can be just poured over a mofongo — in which case we are talking of mofongo relleno. The preparation starts with frying the plantain slices until golden, then mashing them in a pilón, a special mortar from Puerto Rico.

The Traditional Victoria Sponge,"The Victoria sponge cake (a.k.a. Victoria sandwich) was popular with both adults and children during Victorian high tea. Made with equal parts eggs, flour, sugar, and fat, plus baking powder, the Victoria sponge is basically made the same way as pound cake. And while the original Victoria sponge, as Queen Victoria would have it, only consists of two cake layers with a strawberry or raspberry jam center, most modern recipe variations also add a spread of buttercream. Also, other than a dusting of caster sugar, the cake has no other decorations or icings. However, the cake has spread worldwide, and over the years, variations have developed, mainly regarding the filling. Some of those variations call for such fillings as lemon curd, cream and strawberries, apricot jam, whipped cream, and other flavored creams.

Irish Stew,"Widely regarded as a poor man's meal, Irish stew is based on what most Irish people had on hand during difficult times — sheep meat (usually mutton, as lamb or goat meat was considered a luxury), potatoes, and onions. If the opportunity allowed, the aroma of the stew was decorated with additions such as carrots, leeks, cabbage, parsley, chives, turnips, thyme, or even barley grains. Even though the number of additions to the two essential ingredients (meat and potatoes) is a subject of debate on what amount makes the stew traditional, it is up to personal preference or circumstances. If anything, it shows the resourcefulness of the people who made the Irish stew into what it is today. As a staple of the everyday diet for many generations, Irish stew has many variations. Many Irish families keep records of their own recipes with unique twists and tweaks to the stew's disarmingly simple formula. In America, where many Irish people moved over the last two centuries, mutton or lamb meat is often replaced with beef. Many traditional Irish pubs offer Irish stew with an addition of another Irish staple lending its aroma to the broth – the famous Guinness stout.","Ireland, Europe",4.0,"['1.5kg (3 1/3 lbs) mutton or lamb chops, cut into 2.5cm (1-inch) dices', '1kg (2.2 lbs) potatoes, peeled and cut into halves (or smaller sections if large)', '3 to 4 medium onions, roughly chopped', '3 to 4 carrots, cut into thick angled slices, optional', 'salt, to taste', 'ground black pepper, to taste', 'water, as needed']",4 Servings,PREP 20min,COOK 1h,-,READY IN 1h 20min,TasteAtlas,"['Prepare a large-sized Dutch oven or a casserole dish and fill it with water.', 'Add the potato, the meat, and enough water to cover the ingredients.

Classic Vol-Au-Vent In The Style Of Carême,"The vol-au-vent, which means windblown, is a French dish that can be served both as an appetizer (with savory fillings) or as a dessert if the fillings are sweet. The very first step in the preparation of the vol-au-vent is making the puff pastry or the flaky pastry. Flour is combined with salt and water to make an elastic, silky dough, which is then covered in butter, rolled, and turned for at least six rounds until it reaches its characteristic layered consistency. The puff pastry is then formed into round chimney-like structures made out of a bottom, disc-shaped layer and the top layer in the form of a ring glued together with water. The remaining smaller disc left from the center of the ring is used as a lid. During baking, the pastry rises and creates a cylinder cavity that can be filled with meat, fish, or vegetable-based sauces, often enhanced with wine or liqueurs.","Paris, France",4.6,"['PUFF PASTRY', '500g (1.1 lbs) flour', '300 ml (1 ¼ cup) water', '1 ½ tsp salt', '500g (1.1 lbs) butter', '1 egg', 'SAUCE FINANCIÈRE', 'lean ham', 'pinch of mignonette', 'thyme', 'bay leaf', 'mushroom and truffle trimmings', '2 tbsp consommé', '2 ½ glasses dry Madeira']",6 Servings,PREP 1h,COOK 1h,RESTING 5h 20min,READY IN 7h 20min,TasteAtlas,"['First, prepare the puff pastry.

Donauwelle,"Made of layers of vanilla and chocolate pound cake, sour cherries, German buttercream, and chocolate glaze, donauwelle, or Danube wave cake in English, is a classic German and Austrian sheet cake.

The sour cherries are pressed into the batter, and the whole thing is baked. Once cooled, it is spread with German buttercream, which is basically vanilla pudding custard mixed with creamed butter. Finally, the chocolate glaze is poured over the cake in preferably two layers, and before the glaze is fully set, a wavy pattern is made in the glaze by running a fork through it. Donauwelle is also known as Schneewittchenkuchen, or Snow White cake in English, because the colors of the cake, black, red, and white, are the same as the colors of Snow White’s complexion and hair. However, a cake bearing that name has a variation where instead of German buttercream, the cake is spread with cream with quark and topped with a cherry juice glaze.

There are two ways to make an apple cobbler: the first method places the sliced and spiced apples on the bottom of a buttered baking dish and the dough or batter on top; the second one suggests pouring the batter into the baking pan first and scattering the apples on top. Other than with customary cinnamon and sugar, apples can be seasoned with honey, molasses, allspice, nutmeg, grated ginger, and even orange or lemon zest. Also, the apples can be pre-baked or even pre-cooked to become slightly softer, which is especially applicable for sour, firm-fleshed varieties such as Granny Smith.

Frico,"Frico is a traditional Italian dish originating from Carnia, a region of Friuli Venezia-Giulia.

Barbecue Snags,"Snags are mildly flavored Australian sausages typically made with a mixture of beef and pork, though other kinds do exist as well, like ones that are all beef or ones made with a more upscale combination of fillings such as lamb and rosemary or beef and red wine. Typically they are barbecued on a flat top grill and served on a slice of white bread topped with caramelized onions and either tomato and barbecue sauce. The basic recipe can be upgraded by making tomato or barbecue sauce from scratch, using artisanal bread, or by caramelizing the onions in beer for example. Also, some recipes advise that the sausages be simmered in water first for 30 minutes before they are grilled, and for a simpler at home preparation, frying them in a pan will also produce good results. For a more complete meal, snags are served with an array of side dishes and salads.","Australia, Australia And Oceania",4.2,"['1kg beef sausages', 'white bread, a slice per sausage', '2 onions', 'BBQ or tomato sauce, as needed', 'oil, as needed']",8 Servings,PREP 10min,COOK 15min,-,READY IN 25min,TasteAtlas,"['Slice the onions, then sauté them in two tablespoons of oil, over medium heat, until golden brown.', 'Add two tablespoons of oil to the pan, then add the sausages and fry them until browned all over.

Palacsinta,"Because they can be whipped up in a matter of minutes and with ingredients found in every pantry, no wonder Hungarians serve these pancakes for any meal of the day, whether as an appetizer, main course, or dessert. Since they can be filled with almost any ingredient imaginable, they are incredibly versatile and can be either savory and sweet. The basic batter is made with flour, eggs, milk, salt, and water, though sparkling water, sugar, and oil can be added as well. Once the batter is made, it is important that it rests in the refrigerator anywhere from 30 minutes to overnight, depending on the recipe, but the longer, the better. Pancakes are cooked on a heated and oiled pan, then filled with the filling of choice, either savory or sweet. Some of the most popular savory fillings include ham, mushrooms, meat, usually leftover meat stew pörkölt, while fruit jams, cocoa, poppy seeds, walnuts, and even chestnut are used as a filling if palacsinta is served as a dessert. Some of the most noted types of sweet palacsinta include Gundel palacsinta which is filled with walnut and poured over with chocolate sauce and rakott palacsinta, a layered pancake cake, usually with a fruit jam, ground walnuts, poppy seeds, and cottage cheese filling.

Mac And Cheese,"The first step in preparing this American staple is to make the sauce. The base is a simple béchamel sauce made from butter, flour, and milk, which is then turned into a Mornay sauce (another French classic) by adding grated or shredded cheese, usually cheddar. The prepared sauce is poured over boiled macaroni — elbow macaroni is the traditional choice — and tossed to make sure the pasta is evenly coated. The dish can be served like this, but the resulting mass is usually put into a casserole dish, sprinkled with breadcrumbs, and baked until the top has a lovely golden crust, and the insides are bubbly. The sauce can be made as thick or as thin as one prefers; it can be modified to include different cheese varieties; or be flavored with spices and herbs.

Original Caesar Salad,"Although the preparation of Caesar salad is quite simple, this dish was considered glamorous because, in Caesar’s restaurant, it was usually prepared ceremonially in front of the guests. The first step is to wash and dry Romaine lettuce and chill it in the refrigerator, leaving the leaves whole. Garlic oil is prepared by crushing garlic cloves and leaving them in salad oil; the pieces of garlic need to be removed before seasoning. Croutons are made by cutting French bread into small cubes and baking them shortly in an oven until they turn golden brown, and the Parmesan cheese should be freshly grated. Other seasonings include pre-made Worcestershire sauce, olive oil, salt, and pepper. In the end, some lemon juice and one raw egg are added, and the salad is mixed gently but thoroughly.

Hot fudge sundae, created by heating the flavored syrup before drizzling it over the ice cream, is a sundae variation usually made with chocolate, caramel, or butterscotch sauce.

Foie Gras Au Torchon,"According to French law, foie gras is defined as a liver of a duck or goose that's been fattened through a process called gavage, which is a method of force-feeding corn with a feeding tube. Also, foie gras comes in various, legally defined presentations. There are whole liver lobes, one or two, called foie gras entier, liver pieces which are reassembled together are labeled just as foie gras, while a cooked, moulded block with 98% or more foie gras is called bloc de foie gras. In case it is labeled avec morceaux it is mandatory that it contains at least 50% of goose foie gras pieces or in case of duck, 30%. Pâté de foie gras and mousse de foie gras should have at least 50% if not more of foie gras, while 75% of foie gras or more should be used in parfait de foie gras. When it comes to cooking foie gras, there are many techniques out there, and they are usually divided into hot and cold preparations. Some cook foie gras completely as in the case of searing, while others are raw preparations, as in the case of foie gras au torchon. However, the most traditional and popular is foie gras terrine, where foie gras is cooked in a bain-marie and then cooled in the refrigerator for at least a day. Foie gras mousse is also quite popular, as well as pâté of foie gras. Usually served as an appetizer, foie gras can be eaten hot or cold and is typically paired with toasted bread, and sweet or red wines. Also, depending on the preparation, foie gras can also be served with various sauces, or with various fruit preserves and dried fruits.

Traditional Larousse Gastronomique'S Ratatouille,"One of the most famous French dishes in the world, ratatouille, is a humble vegetable stew hailing from the French region of Provence.

It can be enjoyed in a myriad of different ways, whether hot as a side dish or cold as a topping for sandwiches or buckwheat crêpes. Since the vegetables used in this recipe are all exceptionally flavorful, ratatouille is usually seasoned only with sea salt, olive oil, and cracked pepper.

Various recipes substitute corn syrup with either molasses, maple syrup, or sugar, while pecans, either ground or whole, are sometimes added to the custard to act also as a thickener.

Yankee Pot Roast,"How ever easy it may appear at first glance, a pot roast requires not only time but also attention to detail if one wants it to turn out perfect. It is usually made with beef, but pork and lamb work just fine as well. However, only cheaper cuts of meat like brisket, chuck, and round roast should be used as they benefit from long braising due to lots of connective tissues that release collagen during cooking which makes for a meltingly tender meat and an excellent gravy. Root vegetables like carrots, potatoes, onions, parsnips, and turnips are typically called for, but there is no limit to what kinds of vegetables can be added. Other ingredients include stock, red wine, tomatoes or tomato paste, and various aromatics and seasonings such as bay leaf, thyme, and rosemary. The preparation starts with searing the meat in a pot, then sautéeing the onions and herbs. The meat is then removed, and the pot is deglazed with red wine or stock, after which the meat is returned together with tomato paste. The stock is poured in, and the pot is covered with a lid, then placed in a preheated oven to cook for two to three hours over medium heat.

Commercy Madeleines,"There are not so many recipes that earned their place in the history of fine literature the way that did madeleines, a modest but nonetheless sophisticated dessert that evoked a wave of memories in Marcel Proust’s 1913 classic, In Search of Lost Time. Madeleine cakes come in the form of a seashell, are rather easy to make, and are usually served in the afternoon during tea-time. The traditional base for madeleines is génoise cake batter, characteristic of using whole eggs instead of separating egg whites from egg yolks. Most recipes include adding the lemon zest to accentuate the buttery taste, and older versions include adding rum, orange-flower infusion, and finely ground almonds to the mixture.

Variations on the original include using different flavored ice creams, adding fruit, nuts or compote to the ice cream and using various kinds of biscuits or cookies.

You can either precut the wafers and the frozen ice cream to the desired size, then sandwich them together, or first, spread one wafer with softened ice cream, then top with the other biscuit.

"Unsweetened, Southern-Style Cornbread","Mainly associated with the South, in its simplest and most traditional form cornbread — also known as corn pone — is made from cornmeal, salt, and water batter and is baked in a cast iron skillet over an open fire. Today, there is a general divide on how cornbread is prepared depending on where you are in the United States. In the South, the batter is prepared with white cornmeal, sometimes buttermilk, and little to no sugar, while in the North they will use yellow cornmeal, and add wheat flour, eggs, milk or buttermilk, a leavening agent, and some sugar, which gives for a sweeter, more cake-like cornbread. The most popular way to cook cornbread, however, is to skillet-bake it, meaning the prepared batter is poured into a hot, greased cast-iron skillet and then baked until the cornbread is lightly brown. Albeit, cornbread, and its many derivatives — hush puppies, johnnycakes, and spoon bread — can also be baked, fried, or steamed, depending on the recipe. This bread can be served a myriad of different ways. It can be steeped in milk or buttermilk and eaten with a spoon for breakfast, or served as a side with barbecue, chili con carne, and pinto beans. In the South, they eat it with molasses, while in the Northern regions of United States they pair it with honey. Besides being a side to almost any meal imaginable, cornbread is also used as stuffing for Thanksgiving, especially in the South.","United States Of America, North America",4.1,"['3 cups stone-ground cornmeal', '2 tsp kosher salt', '2 tsp baking powder', '3/4 tsp baking soda', '3 tsp sugar (optional)', '2 ½ cups buttermilk', '3 eggs', '1 ½ sticks of unsalted butter, melted, divided']",12 Servings,PREP 20min,COOK 45min,-,READY IN 1h 5min,TasteAtlas,"['Set the oven to preheat to 375°F, then place a well-seasoned, 12-inch cast iron skilled on the middle rack of the oven.', 'Next, add cornmeal, salt, baking powder, baking soda, and sugar if you’re using it to a large bowl, then whisk to combine.', 'Take a separate bowl, add to it buttermilk and eggs and while continuously whisking, drizzle in all of the melted butter in, except for one tablespoon.', 'Pour the liquid ingredients into the dry ones, and whisk just until combined.

Traditional Easter Babka,"Moist, spongy and bright yellow, babka is a sweet bread commonly served for Easter in Poland, Ukraine, Belarus and other Central and Eastern European countries. According to Polish Heritage Cookery, the term babka covers a wide range of cakes which need to be taller than they are wide, and be narrower at the top than at the bottom. The preparation of babka starts with mixing yeast with sugar, flour, and milk. The mixture is then left to rise in a warm place. Next, the egg yolks are mixed with sugar and sometimes salt, until they become light yellow and foamy. Yeast and egg yolk mixtures are combined with flour, melted butter, and other additions such as rum, raisins, various candied fruits or citrus peels. Then, the dough can be left to rise. Some recipes suggest doing three rounds, while others do not insist on this step. The dough is transferred into a babka pan which is similar to a classic bundt pan and can have either straight or pleated sides. The babka is baked for 30 to 45 minutes at 170 to 175˚C (340-350°F) and left to cool. After being removed from the baking pan, babka can be dusted with icing sugar or covered in icing before serving.","Poland, Europe",4.5,"['500g (1.1 lb) flour', '8 egg yolks', '50g (1.75 oz) yeast', '200g (7 oz) melted butter', '150g (5.3 oz) sugar', '3/4 cup (180 ml) warm milk', '100g (3.5 oz) candied peel', 'fat, for greasing', 'breadcrumbs']",6 Servings,PREP 20min,COOK 30min,-,READY IN 50min,TasteAtlas,"['Mix 1/2 cup flour, 1 tbsp sugar, yeast and milk and leave it to rise in a warm place.', 'In the meantime, mix the egg yolks with the remaining sugar until foamy.', 'Stir in the risen yeast mixture and the remaining flour.

Tamagoyaki,"The Japanese version of an omelet, tamagoyaki, may require some skill and practice to perfect because a beginner may not get the desired results, at first try, at least. The eggs are whisked using chopsticks together with sugar, salt, soy sauce, and mirin, but seasonings do vary from household to household. To prepare, a thin layer of the egg mixture is then poured into a greased rectangular omelet pan called a makiyakinabe. Once the layer has set, it is carefully rolled into a log using chopsticks. However, it is important that the top of the layer does not dry out before rolling as the egg will not then stick together. Next, another layer of the egg mixture is poured into the pan, and the log is then rolled over that layer. This step is repeated until there is no egg mixture left at which point you transfer the log onto a plate, wait a few minutes for it to cool a bit, and then cut the ends off and slice the log into ½-inch pieces. Some like their tamagoyaki less sweet and may exclude sugar altogether, while some like the eggs sweeter and will up the amount of sugar. When dashi is added to the egg mixture, we are talking of dashimaki tamago, which may prove a challenge to prepare as the mixture is thinner than the one of a regular tamagoyaki. Tamagoyaki is typically served with grated daikon and some soy sauce. It is considered an essential component of a bentō box and is used in making sushi, or as a palate cleanser. In Japan, you can sample tamagoyaki in Japanese gastropubs izakaya and soba restaurants, but also purchase them in department stores.","Japan, Asia",4.7,"['4 large eggs', '1 tsp soy sauce', '1 tbsp mirin', '2 tsp sugar', '1/4 tsp salt', '1 tbsp vegetable oil']",1 Serving,PREP 5min,COOK 8min,-,READY IN 13min,TasteAtlas,"['Whisk the eggs using either chopsticks or a fork together with soy sauce, mirin, sugar, and salt.', 'Pour the oil into a small bowl, then fold a paper towel and dip into the oil.

Chicken Fried Steak,"Today, a staple of Southern cuisine, chicken fried steak, despite its name is not made with chicken, but traditionally, with tenderized beef round. The meat is dredged in flour, then fried in lard, and served ladled with white gravy and mashed potatoes. Sirloin, cube steak, or even more expensive cuts like rib-eye or porterhouse are sometimes used instead of the round, though such finer cuts are not in line with the philosophy of the dish. Also, although the meat is traditionally dredged in flour only once, most people like a richer, thicker coating, so they dredge the meat twice in flour, and once in the egg and milk mixture. Sometimes buttermilk is used instead of the eggs and milk, and flour is commonly seasoned with pepper, paprika, and other seasonings, depending on the recipe.

Baked Ziti By Lidia Bastianich,"Cheesy, saucy, hearty, and filling, baked ziti is a classic of the Italian-American cuisine, a layered casserole consisting of, at its most basic, ziti pasta, tomato sauce, and three types of cheese: mozzarella, ricotta, and parmesan. The preparation starts with cooking the ziti pasta, usually only until halfway done since it will bake later as well. The tomato sauce is made next, and ricotta is often stirred into it before the dish is assembled. All the ingredients are then layered in a baking dish with mozzarella as the final layer. The assembled dish is baked in a preheated oven for up to 30 minutes and should be served once it's had at least five minutes of rest. Variations on the basic include adding ground meat, which can be cooked separately or with the sauce, various cooked vegetables, bacon, mushrooms, or using additional or different types of cheese.

Next, fruits such as strawberries, oranges, nectarines, blueberries, and cherries which can be fresh or canned are placed on the sponge, followed by custard or pastry cream which is poured over. To finish, a layer of whipped cream and garnish in the form of candied fruits, flowers, and nuts, such as glacé cherries, angelica, and chopped almonds are placed on top. Variations include using, for example, different flavored fruit jellies to suspend the sponge and the fruit, using macaroons instead of sponges, or using different kinds of fruits, or even, forgoing the fruit entirely.

The meat is combined with bread or breadcrumbs previously soaked in milk, cheese, either one kind of multiple kinds, eggs, sometimes garlic, and aromatics such as parsley, oregano, and pepper.

Makowiec,"This sweetened cake made with yeasted, egg-rich, dough, and a poppy seed filling is traditionally a centerpiece of every Polish table for Christmas and Easter, but also a common found in Polish households year-round. The dough is made with flour, eggs, yeast, sugar, butter, and milk, while the filling typically consists of ground poppy seeds, milk, sugar, lemon zest, and butter. Some recipes will also add dried fruits, nuts, honey, orange zest, cinnamon to the filling. After the dough has had time to rise, it is rolled to a rectangle, which is then smeared with the poppy seed paste and shaped into a log that is left to rise in the pan. It is then baked in the oven at a moderate temperature for up to an hour, depending on the recipe. Before serving, makowiec is usually dusted with powdered sugar, but can also have some kind of icing, usually a sugar-based one.

Classic Tulumba,"Deep fried in oil and dipped in sugar syrup, tulumba is a Turkish dessert which can, surprisingly, be crispy, soft, and juicy at the same time. Similar to Spanish churros and Italian zeppole or fritelle, this Ramadan specialty is prepared with dough very similar to choux pastry. The process starts with making the syrup by melting sugar in water with some lemon juice. When the syrup starts turning dark, it is cooled down in a refrigerator until tulumba is finished. The dough for tulumba is made by mixing water, butter, sugar and salt in a pot until they start to boil, after which the flour, eggs, and semolina are stirred in. The dough may contain lemon juice or even vinegar, but it can also be prepared without them. Next, the dough is placed in a piping bag with a star-shaped nozzle, which gives the tulumba its distinctive shape. Good timing is crucial in the following step: tulumba pastries are fried in deep vegetable oil until they are crispy on the outside, but still soft on the inside. After draining, the warm tulumba pastries are dipped in cool syrup to obtain their signature glazed appearance. They are commonly served sprinkled with crushed pistachios, and sometimes even with a side of kaymak, Turkish clotted cream made from buffalo milk.","Turkiye, Asia",4.8,"['FOR THE SYRUP', '3 cups sugar', '3 glasses water', '2 tbsp lemon juice', '2 packs vanilla sugar or 1 tsp cinnamon (optional)', 'FOR THE DOUGH', '2 cups water', '1 tbsp butter', '1 tsp sugar', '1/2 tsp salt', '2 1/2 cups flour', '3 eggs', '3 tbsp semolina', '1 tbsp lemon juice', 'FOR FRYING', 'sunflower oil']",6 Servings,PREP 30min,COOK 25min,-,READY IN 55min,TasteAtlas,"['First, prepare the syrup.

Iranian Gaz,"Sweet, chewy and brittle at the same time, studded with pistachios and scented with rosewater — that, in short, is gaz, a praised Iranian delicacy and a member of a large nougat family. Its name stems from a Persian word gaz-angebin which means sap of angebin. It was believed that the main ingredient in gaz, which gave it its recognizable stickiness and chewiness, was the sap of angebin — a kind of a wild tamarisk tree native to the Zagros Mountain near the Iranian city of Isfahan. However, it turned out that gaz-angebin is, in fact, an exudate of an insect called tamarisk manna scale, which inhabits that specific kind of tree. The females produce a sweet, sticky liquid which hardens when exposed to air and resembles a tree sap. This exotic ingredient is harvested from late summer to early autumn. Then, it is sieved, boiled, and strained, after which it is ready for use. Since it is quite rare and expensive, nowadays it is replaced with a combination of sugar and corn or glucose syrup, which yields the same result. The preparation process starts with whipping the egg whites into firm snow. Sugar, corn or glucose syrup, and sometimes honey, are melted over medium heat into a thick syrup, which is combined with the egg whites in a long, labor-intensive process which was made easier with the appearance of stand mixers. Rose water and nuts — most commonly, pistachios and almonds — are stirred in, and the gaz mixture is ready to be shaped. When it comes to shaping, a traditional approach is to roll gaz by hand into long, round strips which are then cut into small pieces around 2-inches in diameter and about 1/2-inch thick. A modern approach suggests cutting gaz into small, bite-sized cubes. Usually, gaz is paired with tea or sherbet and served as an everyday dessert or on various festive occasions, such as Nowruz — Persian New Year. A beautifully decorated box of gaz is an appreciated gift among Iranians and a popular souvenir among tourists.","Isfahan, Iran",3.9,"['MERINGUE', '2 egg whites', '1 cup sugar', '1/2 cup glucose or corn syrup', '2 tbsp water', 'SYRUP', '1 ½ cup sugar', '1 ½ cup corn syrup (or glucose syrup)', 'ADDITIONS:', '1 ½ cup almonds or pistachios, blanched and toasted', '2 tbsp butter or ghee, melted', '2 tsp rose water or vanilla extract']",12 Servings,PREP 25min,COOK 40min,-,READY IN 1h 5min,TasteAtlas,"['Grease one baking pan and one large bowl with butter.', 'First, make the meringue.

Original Provençal Tapenade,"Preparing tapenade is a no-brainer: olives, capers, and anchovies are pounded together until they form a thick purée, and the liquid ingredients — olive oil and lemon juice — are added gradually at the end. Traditional preparation calls for a mortar and a pestle, but by using a blender, you can have your tapenade ready in a matter of seconds. A South-French specialty, tapenade can be made with black or green olives, which need to be pitted and well-drained before preparation. Since olives and anchovies are salty enough, there is no need to add salt — a pinch of pepper will do. A hint of acidity is brought by pickled capers (which are flower buds of the namesake plant) and a drizzle of lemon. Some recipes suggest adding some finely minced garlic and a spoonful of mustard, but these might come as a distraction to the original taste. The density of tapenade can be adjusted by dosing the amount of olive oil — the idea is to reach a consistency of a spread that will hold firmly on toast, sliced baguette, or bread sticks which are a usual serving proposal. Tapenade can also be used as a filling for hard-boiled eggs, as an addition to various sauces, or as a meat filling, and, since its preparation is rather simple, the most important factor is to purchase the best-quality ingredients you can buy.","Provence, France",4.4,"['200g (7 oz) black olives, pitted', '3 tbsp capers', '4 garlic cloves', '2 anchovy fillets', '12 tbsp olive oil', '2 tbsp Cognac']",4 Servings,PREP 5min,-,-,READY IN 5min,TasteAtlas,"['Add all the ingredients to the bowl of your food processor and mix.', 'While mixing, gradually add the olive oil and the cognac — this is the key to the success of your tapenade.', 'Vary the texture: mix until you get a slightly grainy tapenade or longer for a smoother tapenade.']",https://www.tasteatlas.com/tapenade/recipe,https://www.tasteatlas.com/images/recipes/9a4d936466d3463aaae9f7ab1d9cead6.jpg?mw=910
Classic Nagasaki Champon,"Typical for the Japanese city of Nagasaki, champon is a rich, filling noodle dish with pork, seafood, and vegetables simmered in a savory broth. Generally, it belongs in the ramen dish family, and the main element which differentiates it from ramen is the fact that all the ingredients are cooked in the same pot or wok. The first step is frying the ingredients in lard — generally, the meat, cabbage, carrots, and onions are fried first, followed by more delicate ingredients such as seafood, sprouts, and mushrooms. Then, a stock seasoned with soy sauce, mirin, and sake is poured in, and the ingredients are simmered shortly before the finishing touch — the addition of champon noodles. Champon is served piping hot in deep serving bowls, and has several regional varieties. The cities of Tottori and Amagasaki season it with extra soy sauce, in Akita miso soup is used instead of broth, while in the city of Okinawa topping includes a scrambled egg, and noodles are substituted with rice.","Nagasaki, Japan",4.3,"['100 g pork', '2 small oysters', '40 g prawns', '120 g cabbage', '1 kikurage (wood ear) mushroom', '2 spring onions', '80 g onion', '40 g kamaboko', '120 g bean sprouts', '4 tsp lard', '1,6 l chicken stock', '3 tbsp soy sauce', '2 tbsp sake', '1,5 tsp salt', 'pepper, to taste', '4 packs champon noodles']",4 Servings,PREP 10min,COOK 20min,-,READY IN 30min,TasteAtlas,"['Cut the pork into bite-sized pieces.

Classic New Mexico Breakfast Burrito,"Conceived in Mexico and born in New Mexico, USA, breakfast burrito is a hearty dish that could easily be mistaken for lunch or dinner. It is hearty, satiable, versatile, and often spicy and filled with calories. Preparing a breakfast burrito starts with a humble corn or wheat tortilla, and the filling ingredients depend on the region and, of course, personal preferences. For instance, in New Mexico, breakfast burritos are filled with eggs, meat, and potatoes, and smothered in red and green chile sauce. The potatoes can be shredded or cut into cubes but must be fried and crispy. Bacon is the most common meat choice, but chorizo sausages, ham, carne asada, and other pork varieties are also an option. Cheese — usually Monterrey Jack or cheddar — is either packed into a burrito or sprinkled on top and melted in the oven. Other fillings include avocados, beans, spinach, tomatoes, peppers, and soft cheeses such as feta or goat cheese. Generally, the breakfast burrito is a savory dish, but sweet varieties also exist. The breakfast burrito is usually prepared in two ways, either as a handheld version, practical for a breakfast on the go because all the ingredients are packed inside the burrito, or smothered in sauce and melted cheese, served on a shallow plate, in which case it is eaten with a fork.","Santa Fe, United States Of America",4.3,"['FOR THE BURRITO', '1⁄4 cup (60 ml) vegetable oil', '3 large russet potatoes, shredded', '1⁄2 tsp salt', 'freshly ground black pepper', '1 medium onion, chopped', '1 garlic clove, minced', '2-3 large eggs, lightly beaten', '4 flour tortillas, warmed', '8 slices bacon, cooked until crisp', '6-8 oz (170 - 225g) mild cheddar cheese, grated', 'FOR THE GREEN CHILE SAUCE', '2 tbsp vegetable oil', '1 medium onion, finely chopped', '2-3 garlic cloves, minced', '1 tbsp all-purpose flour', '2 cups (480g) chopped roasted mild to medium-hot New Mexican green chile, fresh or thawed frozen', '2 cups (480 ml) chicken or beef stock', '1⁄2 tsp salt, or more to taste', 'FOR THE RED CHILE SAUCE', '8 oz (225g) (20-25 pcs) dried whole red New Mexican chile pods', '4 cups (1 L) water or chicken stock (divided use)', '2 tbsp vegetable oil', '1 medium onion, minced', '3 garlic cloves, minced', '1-2 tsp crumbled dried Mexican oregano or marjoram', '1 tsp salt, or more to taste']",4 Servings,PREP 15min,COOK 1h 30min,-,READY IN 1h 45min,TasteAtlas,"['Start with preparing the green and red chile sauce.', 'For the green chile sauce, sauté onion and garlic in a saucepan over medium heat for about 5 minutes, until the onion becomes soft.

White Russian,"Made with vodka, coffee liqueur, and cream, the White Russian is a cocktail typically served in an Old-Fashioned glass. The proportions of the ingredients do vary from recipe to recipe, as there is no one fixed recipe. Some call for equal parts of all three, as is the case of the first known recipe for the cocktail, while others variate the proportions, typically vodka making up the biggest portion of the drink. The brands of coffee liqueur that are most commonly used are Kahlúa and Tia Maria, although most cocktail buffs prefer to make their own liqueur. Also, even though cream is the typical ingredient, half and half and milk are often used instead. The usual way of making this cocktail is to first, fill a glass with ice, then add the vodka and the coffee liqueur and mix them with a spoon. The cream is then floated over ice, and the drink is gently stirred, so the black and white layer remain somewhat separate. Alternatively, the cream is shaken so it stiffens a bit before it's poured into a cocktail, while vodka and the coffee liqueur can be shaken in a shaker before they are poured into a glass. Some recipes call for the three ingredients to be first mixed in a shaker and then double strained into an ice-filled glass.","California, United States Of America",4.4,"['5 cl (50 ml) (1 2/3 oz) vodka', '2 cl (20 ml) (2/3 oz) coffee liqueur', 'cream, as desired (about 3 cl) (30 ml) (1 oz)']",1 Serving,PREP 5min,-,-,READY IN 5min,TasteAtlas,"['Fill an Old-Fashioned glass with ice, then add the vodka and the coffee liqueur, and stir.', 'Float the cream over the ice, then carefully stir.']",https://www.tasteatlas.com/white-russian/recipe,-
Traditional Peach Cobbler,"As a dessert developed literary ""on the road"", peach cobbler is prepared with only the most basic ingredients. This fruit dessert is essentially a deep-dish fruit casserole consisting of sugar-sprinkled peaches covered with a layer of rough biscuit dough or pie dough, baked in an oven until golden. Its trademark juiciness comes from the fact that the peaches and sugar release a thick syrup during baking. Old fashion recipe versions suggested inverting the peach cobbler, so the fruit ends up on top. Modern variations, on the other hand, propose either peaches on the bottom and dough on the top or preparing a batter similar to the one used for cakes, placing the fruit on it, and letting the batter rise during baking to envelop the peaches. The process starts with dicing or slicing the peaches, which are then placed on a bottom of a deep dish baking pan, sprinkled with sugar, and covered with butter. Lemon juice, cinnamon, and nutmeg can be added to accentuate the flavor. Next, the dough is prepared by mixing flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt, then adding butter and milk or heavy cream. The dough can be transferred on top of the peaches by using a spoon, or it can be rolled with a rolling pin to form a sheet. The cobbler is then baked until its top gets a golden hue, and it is most commonly served warm or tepid with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.","United States Of America, North America",4.3,"['FILLING', '3 cups (450g) peaches, peeled and sliced', '1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar', '1/4 cup (4 tbsp) butter, cut into small pieces + more for buttering the baking dish', 'FOR THE CRUST', '1 cup (120g) all-purpose flour', '2 tsp baking powder', '1 tbsp granulated sugar', '1 tsp salt', '1/4 cup (4 tbsp) butter', '1/2 cup (120 ml) (or less) heavy cream']",6 Servings,PREP 10min,COOK 35min,-,READY IN 45min,TasteAtlas,"['Butter a 1 1/2-quart (1.4 L) baking dish and cover the bottom with a layer of peaches.

Naturally Leavened Colomba Pasquale,"Colomba pasquale, also known as colomba di Pasqua, is a naturally-leavened artisanal sweet bread commonly found on Italian dining tables during Easter (Pasqua). Due to its dove-like shape and Easter-related origins, the cake became known as colomba pasquale, meaning Easter dove. Much like traditional Italian Christmas cakes pandoro and panettone, colomba pasquale is a delicate, soft, and fragrant cake made with simple ingredients such as wheat flour, eggs, sugar, salt, butter, mother yeast, and candied orange peel. The fact that colomba pasquale is a registered PAT product (the cake’s ingredients and characteristics are regulated by law) shows just how big of a staple of the Italian culture the cake has become. Similar to pandoro and panettone, colomba pasquale is a naturally leavened and time-consuming delicacy to make. The dough is based on mother yeast and is prepared in two stages in which the main ingredients such as flour, butter, and egg yolks are gradually incorporated. Although the original colomba pasquale uses a few ingredients, common variations call for the addition of honey, milk, cocoa butter, and vanilla to the dough. Traditionally, colomba pasquale is glazed with almond-based icing, topped with whole almonds and crystal sugar, and baked in a dove-shaped mold. Colomba is best served with sweet wines such as Oltrepò Moscato, Moscato d’Asti, or Passito di Pantelleria.","Milan, Italy",4.1,"['1 tbsp (15g) acacia honey', '1 vanilla bean, seeds scraped out', '1 orange, zest', '8.1 oz (230g) 00 flour 350W - P/L 0.55', '4 oz (115 ml) water', '2.3 oz (65g) mother yeast', '5 tbsp (70g) granulated sugar', '2.5 oz (70g) butter', '1.75 oz (50g) egg yolks (about 3)', 'first dough', '2 oz (60g) 00 flour 350W - P/L 0.55', '1/5 tbsp (1g) barley malt', '4 tbsp (60g) granulated sugar', '3 oz (85g) egg yolks', '1/2 tsp (3g) salt', 'aroma emulsion', '3.5 oz (100g) butter', '6.2 oz (175g) cubed candied orange', '4 tbsp (25g) almond flour', '4 oz (120g) icing sugar', '1.6 oz (45g) egg whites']",10 Servings,-,COOK 2h,-,READY IN 2h,TasteAtlas,"['Prepare the aromatic emulsion one day in advance.

Baleada,"Often nicknamed the poor man's burrito, baleada consists of a thick flour tortilla that is first spread with mashed refried red beans, then sprinkled with Honduran hard, salty cheese (queso duro) and topped with a dollop or two of mantequilla crema, a form of salty Honduran sour cream. The tortilla is then folded in half, and baleada is ready to serve. Tortillas are typically made only with flour, salt, baking powder, oil, and some type of liquid, either water, milk, or coconut milk. Alternatively, tortilla recipes can include eggs, sugar, and butter instead of oil. Depending on the region and the type of ingredients added to the tortilla, baleadas can be classified into three different subgroups. Simple baleadas, as described earlier, can turn into special baleadas if you add scrambled eggs to the filling. The third subgroup is the super special baleadas. They are the type of baleadas that can have an almost unending list of additional ingredients — from vegetables such as plantains, avocado, bell peppers, onions, or vegetable salsa chismol, to meats like pork, beef, sausages, and grilled meat.

Traditional Fritule With Yeasted Dough,"Fritule, sweet round fritters from Dalmatia are a festive treat, traditionally prepared for Christmas and carnival time. The typical fritters are made with a yeasted dough that can be enriched with eggs, although in the past, it was more commonly prepared with choux pastry that could also include potatoes. However, today, it is frequently prepared with a looser dough that has yogurt and baking powder as ingredients instead of yeast. The key ingredient that needs to be included no matter what dough is used is alcohol, typically brandy — but rum or white wine are also an option — which helps the fritters not soak up as much oil during frying. Nuts, grated apples, spices, and citrus peels are often added to the dough for more flavor and moisture. Traditionally, fritule were fried in lard, but nowadays, oil is typically used. Once fried, fritule are left to drain on paper towels, and while hot, they are traditionally rolled in granulated or powdered sugar.

Simple Blueberry Cobbler,"Modest and easy to make, the blueberry cobbler is a dessert that requires no exotic ingredients, just some flour, sugar, salt, baking soda, butter, cornstarch, milk, and, of course, blueberries — fresh or frozen. First, the blueberries are scattered on the bottom of a deep baking pan and covered with some sugar and cornstarch, which thickens the juice released during baking and prevents the cobbler from becoming soggy. Next, dollops of batter are placed on top of the blueberries: the batter is made by mixing the dry ingredients such as flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt with some milk and butter until just combined. There is no need to put in extra effort to make the batter smooth — it actually needs to be rough and cobbled, just as the name says. Another method suggests placing the blueberries on top of the batter: to prevent them from sinking, roll them in some flour. The blueberry cobbler is then baked at 350°F/180°C for 45 to 50 minutes, or until the top becomes golden brown: note that with fresh blueberries, this amount of time may be even shorter.

Italian Academy Of Cuisine'S Pasta Chî Sàrdi,"Pasta chî sàrdi (a.k.a. pasta con le sarde) is one of the most original dishes native to Palermo, Sicily. While there are many variations of this dish, traditionally the sauce is made with the following ingredients: onions, wild fennel, saffron, golden raisins, pine nuts, breadcrumbs, anchovies, and sardines. It is a seasonal dish that can be prepared from March to September because that’s the only time when fresh sardines are found at the market, and wild fennel can be harvested in the fields. The pasta of choice for this dish is bucatini, but spaghetti can be used instead. When it comes to variations, some exclude the breadcrumbs, some add tomatoes in the form of tomato paste, while others call for baking the dish in the oven. Pasta chî sàrdi perfectly combines ingredients that, at first glance, are difficult to merge.

Tourtière,"Tourtière is a spiced meat pie made with shortcrust pastry and a generously seasoned stuffing consisting of ground or cubed meat, onions, and potatoes. Each region has its own different version of the dish, each with its own special intricacies. Nevertheless, some basic steps must be followed when preparing any version of the dish. The dough for the pie is shortcrust pastry — lard is often recommended as shortening, resulting in an especially delicious and flaky pastry. The type of meat varies from pork and veal to wild game or even fish. Whether ground or cubed, the meat is sometimes pre-cooked before being baked in the pie, and the stuffing can be thickened with the addition of oatmeal or breadcrumbs. Once the stuffing has been prepared, it is wrapped in dough and baked in a casserole dish.

Tamalitos vary in size, from very small ones up to giant ones weighing more than 2 kilos (4.5 lbs), and can be savory and sweet. The usual wrapping is corn husks, but banana and bijao leaves are also often used. And finally, tamalitos usually don’t have a filling but often have one.

Classic BLT Sandwich,"Fast, simple and easy, the recipe for a BLT sandwich requires virtually no culinary knowledge or skill, but still manages to result in a dish that is both basic and rich. The preparation starts with lightly toasting the slices of bread, which can either be done in a toaster oven, a regular oven, or on a skillet. One side of toasted bread is then covered with mayonnaise, thin slices of tomato, lettuce (either shredded or in leaves) and broiled bacon slices. Another slice of the toasted bread covered in mayonnaise is placed on top, and the assembled sandwich is usually cut into triangles and sometimes fixated using a toothpick or a wooden stick. Just like many other simple recipes, the BLT sandwich also relies on the quality of its ingredients. A common mistake is to consider the BLT to be a bacon sandwich seasoned with lettuce and tomato, when in fact tomato is the basic ingredient which carries most of the character, and every other ingredient is in its service. Therefore, the tomatoes should be ripe and firm, and their flavor can be enhanced with seasoning them directly with salt and freshly ground pepper.","United States Of America, North America",4.4,"['1/2 lb (225g) bacon (12 slices)', '8 slices white bread', '8 lettuce leaves', '8 slices of ripe tomatoes', '8 tbsp mayonnaise']",4 Servings,PREP 7min,COOK 8min,-,READY IN 15min,TasteAtlas,"['Prepare the bacon first; cook it so it becomes crispy, and then place on some paper towels to drain.', 'Next, toast the bread and spread a tablespoon of mayonnaise on each slice.', 'Now, assemble the sandwiches in the following order: toast with mayonnaise side up, 1 lettuce leaf, 2 slices of tomato, 3 bacon slices, 1 lettuce leaf, toast with mayonnaise side down.

The Original Onion Rings,"Preparing onion rings may seem simple, but there is a whole set of rules to follow to make them perfectly crispy on the outside and cooked on the inside. First, large onions — preferably yellow ones — are peeled and cut crosswise into 1/4 to 1/2-inch-thick slices. Flour is mixed with salt and other optional dry ingredients such as pepper, paprika, baking powder, baking soda, cornstarch, and cornmeal. Eggs are used in most recipes, and the main liquid ingredient depends on the recipe and can include milk, buttermilk, beer, mineral water, vodka, or cream. Dry and liquid ingredients are then combined into a thick batter in which the onion rings are dipped. Alternatively, the onion rings can be dipped in flour first, then immersed in a mixture of eggs and the main liquid ingredient, and dipped in flour or breadcrumbs once again. The rings are fried shortly in deep, hot oil heated to a temperature ranging from 350 to 375˚F.

Then, a sweet sandwich is assembled in the following order — a graham cracker is topped with chocolate, which is followed by a hot marshmallow and another graham cracker. Hot marshmallows will cause the chocolate to melt, making s’mores ready for consumption. Two close relatives to s’mores are Mallomars — a graham cracker cookie topped with marshmallow and covered with chocolate, and the MoonPie — two round graham crackers with a marshmallow filling in between, also chocolate coated.","United States Of America, North America",4.1,"['8 sticks (for toasting the marshmallows)', '16 graham crackers', '8 bars plain chocolate, broken in two', '16 marshmallows']",8 Servings,PREP 3min,COOK 5min,-,READY IN 8min,TasteAtlas,"['Poke two marshmallows onto each stick and toast them over coals.', 'When they become gooey and crispy, take them off the sticks.

Sauerkraut,"One of the simplest fermentation recipes out there, to make sauerkraut you need nothing more than cabbage, salt, and a container in which the fermentation will take place. The stem is removed from the head of the cabbage which is then shredded and mixed with salt. After cabbage has had time to rest, it is squeezed to extract all the liquid, then placed in a sterilized container, either a crock or a mason jar, depending on the amount of cabbage. The leftover liquid is poured over the cabbage and acts as a brining solution. The cabbage is then pressed with a heavy object, and the container is covered with a cloth and secured with rubber so that the air can circulate, but dust and insects can’t fall into it. Over the next 24 hours, the cabbage should become more and more limp and compact as time passes, so that at the end of 24 hours it is entirely covered in its liquid. If that does not happen, water needs to be added. The container should be placed in a cold, dark place to ferment. The lenght of fermentation will vary on the amount of cabbage, from a few days for smaller jars, to a few weeks in case an entire barrel of cabbage is cured. Sauerkraut is typically made with white cabbage, but any other cabbage will do. Ingredients like caraway seeds, bay leaves or peppercorns are added to the cabbage for flavor. If stored in a cold and dark place, sauerkraut can keep for months. For consumption, sauerkraut is served fresh as a side to various meats and sausages, but can also be sautéed before use.","Germany, Europe",3.8,"['1 small head green cabbage (about 3 pounds; 1.4kg), trimmed, cored, and shredded, outer leaves reserved', '28g salt, plus more as needed', '1 teaspoon (4g) caraway seeds or juniper berries (optional)']",Serving,PREP 1h,-,-,READY IN 1h,TasteAtlas,"['Shred the cabbage with a knife or a mandolin.

Panettone,"This half-bread, half-cake is typically shaped like a dome with either a cylindrical, octagon or a frustum base and is usually 12-15 cm high. The preparation that can last even up to a few days begins with making the sourdough starter which is then kneaded with flour to make a smooth dough. A small amount of milk together with melted butter, eggs, yolks, and sugar syrup is added next, followed by candied peel and fruits like orange, lemon, and cedar that have been previously shortly soaked in water. The resulting dough is shaped into a ball and placed inside a special panettone mold which helps to keep the dough from overflowing as it bakes. Finally, a baker makes a cross engraving on top and then places the bread into the oven to bake at 200-220°C. After five minutes have passed, the remaining butter is poured on the cross, and the panettone is placed back into the oven to bake at a lower temperature until done. For serving, panettone is cut up in wedges and can be eaten at any time of the day; in the morning with a cup of coffee, as a mid-day snack, or as dolce after a meal with a glass of Marsala or Moscato d’Asti wine. It is also customary to pair panettone with hot beverages like eggnog and hot chocolate.

A layer of crushed, uncooked tomatoes placed on top covers the entire pizza and has the role of protecting the lower layers of pizza topping from overcooking and charring. Often, the tomato sauce is sprinkled with grated parmesan cheese and/or hard cheese. The pizza is baked for about 35 minutes and served, unlike many other pizzas, with a knife and fork.

Traditional Scottish Haggis,"One of the finest examples of traditional Scottish cuisine, haggis may not look attractive at first glance, but it compensates its looks with a rich, meaty taste which some people also describe as earthy and nutty. Basically, haggis is a savory pudding prepared with meat, oatmeal, onions, suet, salt, and pepper, and in this case, meat refers to sheep’s pluck or offal — heart, lungs, and liver. The haggis is traditionally encased in a sheep’s stomach, which is, in modern times, sometimes replaced with a synthetic sausage casing. The first step is to soak the sheep’s stomach in salted water and to turn it inside out. The heart, lungs, and liver are cooked in unsalted water for 1,5 hours or until tender, after which they are left to cool. The stock is reserved for later preparation, while the pluck is chopped, minced or grated, and mixed with onions, suet, lightly toasted oatmeal, salt, and pepper. The mixture is then stuffed into the sheep’s stomach, which is tied or sewn, pierced in a few spots, and cooked for 3 hours until it swells. Prior to serving, haggis is transferred onto a serving plate, patted dry, and cut with a sharp knife, so the delicious, crumbly filling pours out. The color of the filling can range from light brown to almost black, which depends on the proportion of the used ingredients. Traditionally, haggis is served with a side of bashed neeps and mashed tatties (turnips and potatoes), as well as a glass of Scottish whisky.","Scotland, Europe",4.0,"['sheep’s stomach', 'sheep’s pluck', 'salt', 'ground pepper', 'rosemary', 'sage', 'thyme', 'onion', 'oatmeal', 'suet', 'chopped parsley, for garnishing']",6 Servings,PREP 2h,COOK 3h,-,READY IN 17h,TasteAtlas,"['Place sheep’s pluck in a large bowl of unsalted water.

Traditional Rheinischer Sauerbraten,"A traditional dish of German cuisine, sauerbraten is considered a quintessential fall comfort food. The preparation starts with marinating the meat — traditionally horsemeat, but nowadays most often beef, but also lamb, venison, mutton, rabbit and pork meat — anywhere from three to up to ten days. The marinade base made with red wine vinegar and wine is enriched with various spices and herbs such as peppercorns, bay leaves, mace, coriander, juniper berries, cloves, nutmeg, and many more. It will also often include vegetables like carrots, onions, and celery. After marination, the meat is pat dried and seared in oil or lard, then braised with the leftover marinade for four hours or more, until the meat is succulent and tender. The marinade is strained and thickened with roux, and/or ingredients like crushed gingerbread, lebkuchen, sour cream, and apfelkraut (apple jam).

Italian Academy Of Cuisine'S Lombardian Chiacchiere,"Crunchy, brittle and full of flavor — this, in a nutshell, is chiacchiere, an Italian deep-fried pastry most commonly prepared during carnival and other festive occasions, such as Christmas, New Year and Easter. Made with the simplest ingredients possible — flour, eggs, sugar, salt, and butter — these golden bites still manage to be packed with scents and flavors. Mostly, this can be linked to the fact that the dough is enhanced with lemon or orange zest and liqueur such as the Italian grappa brandy, white wine, rum or Marsala wine. The preparation starts by mixing flour, eggs, egg yolks, butter, salt, sugar, lemon or orange zest, and liqueur, and kneading them into a firm dough. The dough is left to rest shortly, and then it is rolled into thin sheets and cut using a fluted pastry wheel which makes distinctive zigzag edges. Sheets of dough can be cut into rectangles or rhombi, often with an additional incision or two in the middle, or into long strips which are sometimes tied into loose knots.

Classic Fènglísū Cake,"Made from buttery shortbread-like pastry and a pineapple filling, fènglísū is a delicate bite-sized cake, usually in the shape of a short cylinder or rectangle. The filling is prepared first by chopping the pineapple into very small pieces and cooking it over medium heat with some sugar and maltose syrup until all the liquid evaporates and the pineapple reaches a thick, sticky consistency. Next, the dough is prepared by mixing butter with sugar and egg and adding flour, salt, and condensed milk. After cooling in the refrigerator, the dough is divided into pieces. Each piece is rolled out, filled with pineapple jam and assembled into an individual portion. Baking is done in a 170˚C oven, and the cakes are turned over mid-baking, so they are equally baked on both sides. After cooling, the cakes are ready to be served, or they can be stored in air-tight containers to preserve their freshness. Fènglísū is a popular gift for special occasions, including New Year’s celebrations, weddings and engagement rituals — they are often distributed with wedding invitations, or as a thank-you gift after the ceremony. Additionally, fènglísū is a best-selling Taiwanese souvenir, especially among the Asian tourists, who can choose among numerous industrial or artisanal brands, often in beautiful gift boxes.

Classic Veroian Revani,"Simple in appearance but bursting with textures and flavors, revani is a Greek cake which belongs to the siropiasta group of desserts. Just like other sweets from this family, such as baklava, portokalopita, melomakarona, kataifi, samali, and others, its main characteristic is that it is soaked in sugar syrup, which makes it moist and juicy. The preparation of revani begins with mixing the dry ingredients — flour, semolina, baking powder, salt, and sugar — with the wet ones which include eggs, yogurt or milk, and sometimes fat (butter or olive oil). In some recipes, the egg whites are mixed with sugar into a meringue which gives revani a spongy texture. Furthermore, to help achieve revani's typical, grainy texture, semolina can be replaced with ground almonds or flaked or desiccated coconut. The batter is poured into a baking pan and baked in a pre-heated oven for 20 to 40 minutes at 170 to 180˚C. After that, revani is drizzled with a sugar syrup which can be flavored with lemon or orange juice or zest. Revani can be consumed at room temperature, or chilled from the refrigerator. It is often decorated with powdered sugar, desiccated coconut, and pistachios, or served with some whipped cream or Greek ice-cream kaimaki.","Greece, Europe",4.5,"['1 cup cake flour, sifted', '3 tsp baking powder', '1/2 cup fine semolina', '1/2 cup coarse semolina', '1 cup sugar', '3 eggs, separated', '1 yogurt (200g), drained', '1 tsp vanilla extract', 'juice of 1 lemon or orange', '1 pinch of salt', 'SYRUP', '1 ½ cup sugar', '1 ½ cup water', 'juice of 2-3 oranges', '1 tsp lemon juice']",12 Servings,PREP 15min,COOK 40min,-,READY IN 55min,TasteAtlas,"['Preheat the oven to 250˚C.', 'In a large bowl, combine flour, fine and coarse semolina, and baking powder.', 'Separate the egg whites from the egg yolks.', 'Mix the egg yolks with sugar at medium to high speed until light and fluffy.

Yemeni Martabak,"Crispy on the outside and richly stuffed on the inside, martabak is one of the most popular street food dishes across the Western and South-Eastern Asia. Even though it seems simple at first glance, its preparation — if done traditionally — requires some serious skill. When it comes to savory martabak, the first step is to knead flour, salt, water, oil or ghee, and sometimes eggs, into a soft dough. After resting for a while wrapped in plastic foil or soaked in oil, the dough is divided into individual portions which will be turned into thin, roti-like pancakes. Traditionally, small balls of dough are pressed into flat discs and then tossed in the air until they become very thin and almost transparent. Martabak street vendors tend to turn this process into a show for the passers-by, while an at-home preparation suggests merely rolling the dough with a rolling pin. The filling is prepared by mixing sautéed ingredients — usually, onions, garlic, shallots, and minced meat — with the fresh ones, which can include tomato, fresh herbs such as mint and coriander, whisked eggs, and cheese. The filling is spread into the center of the pancake, which is then folded into a rectangular envelope, and carefully transferred onto an oiled griddle or a frying pan. Martabak is cooked on both sides until browned, while the degree of crispiness is a matter of personal preference. Hot martabak is cut into small portions and served with some lemon or lime wedges or dipping sauce. Sweet martabak or martabak manis is particularly popular in Indonesia, and its preparation method is slightly different. The dough is in fact a thick, pancake-like batter made with yeast, which is cooked on one side only. The top is smeared with butter, ghee, peanuts, chocolate, condensed milk, and even cheese, after which the pancake is folded, cut, and served.","Yemen, Asia",4.1,"['DOUGH', '3 cups bread flour', '3/4 cup water', '1/3 cup oil', '1 1/4 tsp salt', '1 egg', 'extra oil', 'FILLING', '½ onion', '1 clove garlic', '½ lb ground meat', '½ tomato', '1 pinch spices (cumin, coriander, ground black pepper, ground red chili powder)', '1 cup leek or green onion', '4 eggs', '½ tsp salt', '2-3 tbsp white cheese, optional']",6 Servings,PREP 30min,COOK 45min,-,READY IN 1h 15min,TasteAtlas,"['First, make the dough.

"Adams ""Original"" Red Velvet Cake","The red velvet cake became the pinnacle of festive desserts in America thanks to its vibrant red color, subtle yet tangy chocolate flavor, and a refreshing French-style ermine icing. The sponge is prepared by first creaming the sugar, eggs, and shortening, to which a paste out of cocoa and food dye is added. Subsequently, salt, flour, buttermilk, and vanilla are added to the mix, alongside soda-induced vinegar. Finally, the batter is poured into several cake pans (3 or 4) and baked. Although the ermine frosting takes a bit of time to prepare, it gives the cake its authentic taste and creaminess. The ermine frosting is made by slowly adding milk to the flour and then cooking it until thickens, stirring the mixture throughout. Sugar, vanilla, and buttercream are added to the cooked mixture that is then beaten until it starts to resemble whipped cream. Newer adaptations of the recipe replaced the ermine frosting with cream cheese frosting because it is less time-consuming to prepare and adds more tanginess to the taste.","Southern United States, United States Of America",3.9,"['SPONGE', '1 tsp soda', '1 cup (240 ml) buttermilk', '1 tbsp vinegar', '1/2 cup (95g) shortening', '1 1/2 cups (300g) sugar', '2 eggs', '1 tsp ""Adams Best"" Vanilla', '1 tsp Adams Butter Flavor', '1 oz (30 ml) Adams Red Color', '3 tbsp cocoa', '2 1/2 cups (300g) sifted flour', '1 tsp salt', 'ICING', '1 lb (450g) sifted confectioners’ sugar', '½ cup (95g) cup shortening', '1 tbsp ""Adams Best"" Vanilla', '1/4 tsp Adams Butter Flavor', '1/2 tsp salt', '5 tbsp milk']",12 Servings,PREP 15min,COOK 25min,RESTING 1h,READY IN 1h 40min,TasteAtlas,"['Preheat the oven at 350°F/180°C.', 'Start working on the batter by creaming the shortening and the sugar.', 'One at a time, add the two eggs to the creamed mixture and keep beating it until the eggs are well incorporated.', 'Next, add the vanilla and butter flavors to the mixture.', 'In a separate bowl, make a paste out of cocoa and food coloring and blend it into the shortening mixture.', 'Sift the dry ingredients together and alternately with half of the buttermilk, add them to the mixture.', 'Then, add the vinegar and the remaining half of the buttermilk to the batter.', 'Lastly, pour the mixture into three 9 or 10-inch (23-25 cm) greased and floured pans and bake for 20-25 minutes.', 'Before covering the layers with frosting, let them cool for at least ten minutes.', 'For the icing, sift the confectioners’ sugar and blend half of it with the two flavors, salt, and shortening.', 'Then, alternately, add the rest of the sugar and milk to the mixture until a smooth spreading icing is formed.']",https://www.tasteatlas.com/red-velvet-cake/recipe,-
Bread Pudding With Whiskey Sauce In New Orleans Style,"Although the basic ingredients are quite ordinary — bread, milk, eggs, and sugar — bread pudding is a dish which can range from simple to extravagant, depending on your inspiration. The preparation starts with some stale white bread, cut into cubes or torn into small pieces. The bread should be dry — either use some leftovers from the previous day or lightly toast the bread cubes in the oven. Milk, eggs, and sugar are mixed in a large bowl, often accompanied with butter, heavy cream, cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla extract, dried fruits, and nuts. This custard-like mixture is poured over the bread cubes and left to soak at room temperature, after which the bread pudding mixture is transferred into a baking dish and baked in the oven. When the surface becomes golden brown and the center sets, the pudding is ready. After it has cooled slightly, the bread pudding is most commonly sprinkled with confectioners’ sugar and drizzled with sauce.

Bûche De Noël,"The quintessential French Christmas dessert, bûche de Noël, can be as simple or as lavish as one would like it to be, adorned with garnishes and elaborative designs or kept as a simple roulade. In general, it is a sweet roulade consisting of a génoise sponge that's spread traditionally with chocolate buttercream and rolled into a cylinder that is then iced with the same buttercream and made to resemble a bark by running a fork through the icing. Still, to mimic the appearance of a log, the ends of the cylinder can be cut off before frosting, and attached to its top or the sides. Also, instead of chocolate buttercream, differently flavored creams or jams can be used instead. As far as decoration, it can consist of just a sprinkling of powdered sugar, which is intended to resemble snow. Meringue mushrooms are also a quite common decorative element, as are various berries, chocolate shavings, ornaments made from fondant, and many others.

Classic Black Sesame Soup,"This traditional Chinese dessert is especially popular in the southern provinces, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, and is characterized by its sweet and nutty flavor. It consists only of black sesame seeds, rice flour, sugar (rock sugar), and water but can be prepared a myriad of different ways. Usually, rice is soaked overnight, and the sesame seeds are toasted, but some recipes start with soaking both the rice and the sesame seeds overnight and then grinding them the following day into a powder which is mixed with water and sugar and cooked until thickened slightly. Others toast the rice flour and sesame seeds and once cooled and ground, cook them with water and sugar. Sometimes rock sugar is used instead of granulated sugar, and the soup may also include additional ingredients like jujube, Chinese rice dumplings filled with sesame paste called tang yuan, peanuts, or walnuts.

Almond Financiers From Larousse Gastronomique,"Financiers are small French cakes traditionally baked in rectangular or round molds. The traditional version is based on ground almonds, melted butter, and whipped egg whites, though most contemporary versions opt for brown butter to impart the cakes with a nutty flavor. The perfect financier will have a springy texture, golden and crispy edges, while the center will remain moist and tender. The preparation is simple but involves certain finesse. It starts with a mixture of dry ingredients — consisting of caster or powdered sugar, ground almonds, and flour — which is whisked with egg whites and butter. The batter is then piped or poured into well-greased molds or tins. When baked, financiers should rise to form a slightly dome-like shape. The classic financier is plain, but the base offers impressive room for adaptation, whether in flavorings or toppings. The most common additions include fresh fruits that are neatly pressed in the batter or slivered nuts sprinkled on top of the cakes. It is also not unusual to toy with the base, and instead of almonds, use other types of ground nuts, such as hazelnuts or even pistachios. Although these elegant almond cakes were often left out from the canonical French recipe books, they have remained a mainstay in French patisseries. They can be enjoyed as a sweet breakfast or as an excellent afternoon pick-me-up.","France, Europe",4.4,"['100g (2/3 cup + 4 tsp) all-purpose flour', '100g (1 cup) ground almonds', '300g (1 ⅓ cups) caster sugar', '8 egg whites', '2-3 tbsp vanilla sugar', '150 g (2/3 cup) unsalted butter', 'pinch of salt', 'plus a little extra butter to coat the molds']",16 Servings,PREP 10min,COOK 20min,-,READY IN 2h 30min,TasteAtlas,"['Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F).', 'Generously butter the financier molds.', 'Cut the butter into pieces and melt it in a saucepan.', 'In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, ground almonds, and both types of sugar.

Ruam Mit,"Ruam mit is an affordable and refreshing dessert that has no set list of ingredients, which means that recipes can vary a lot.

Preparing all the components takes time, but the dessert is actually quite simple to put together. First, coconut milk is prepared by boiling it with sugar and infusing it, usually, with pandan leaves, while other desserts, such as the before mentioned, if they are a part of the recipe, are prepared next.

Basic Chiffon Cake,"Marketed under an intriguing slogan ""the first really new cake in a hundred years"", chiffon cake is somewhere between a butter cake and a sponge cake. Like the butter cake, it contains fat, but its airlight texture is achieved by gently adding whipped egg whites, the procedure was borrowed from the sponge cake recipe. The secret? Instead of butter, margarine or lard, commonly used in butter cakes, chiffon cake uses vegetable oil. The procedure is simple: dry ingredients — flour, sugar, baking powder and salt — are sifted and combined, which is followed by adding the wet ingredients — water, vegetable oil, vanilla extract, egg yolks and, optionally, grated lemon zest. All the ingredients are then mixed until the batter is completely smooth. Egg whites and cream of tartar are whipped or mixed in another bowl until stiff peaks are formed, and then the two mixtures are gently combined, so they retain an airy texture. Depending on the recipe, additional ingredients such as spices, fruit, fruit juice and chocolate can be added to the batter.

Academia Barilla'S Cocoa Bonèt,"Bonèt is a creamy, amaretti-based dessert that is coated in a thin layer of caramel. This pudding-like dessert hails from Piedmont, though it is mainly associated with Langhe and Monferrato. Although it is generally known as a cocoa dessert, the original version was a light-colored dessert that did not include cocoa. This first variation (alla monferrina) appeared in the 13th century as an oven-baked custard made with amaretti cookies, eggs, milk, and sugar. With the introduction of cocoa, the recipe was adapted, and bonèt is now predominantly made with a mixture of eggs, milk, sugar, cocoa, rum, and amaretti cookies. It is traditionally baked in caramel-coated ramekins and should always be served well-chilled.","Piedmont, Italy",4.1,"['500 ml (2 1/4 cups/17 oz) milk', '3 eggs, plus one egg yolk', '150g (3/4 cup) caster sugar', '120g (1 ¼ cup) amaretti cookies', '35g (4 tbsp) cocoa powder, sifted', '5 ml (1 tsp) rum', 'for the caramel', '100g (3.5 oz) water', '300g (1 1/2 cup) sugar']",6 Servings,PREP 15min,COOK 45min,-,READY IN 1h,TasteAtlas,"['Preheat the oven to 150°C (300°F).', 'FOR THE CARAMEL: Put sugar and water in a heavy bottom saucepan on medium heat.

Grasshopper Pie,"A remnant of a bygone era, the grasshopper pie is the epitome of the 1960s. This no-bake dessert consists of a cookie crumb crust and an airy filling flavored with crème de menthe and white crème de cacao. The crust is made with either wafer cookies, graham crackers, or Oreos, which are crumbled and combined with melted butter to make a workable mass that can be pressed into a pie mold. The crust is often baked briefly to help it set, and it can be enriched with ingredients like chocolate, coconut, and a touch of sugar. The filling is predominantly made from eggs and heavy cream, but some recipes use marshmallows instead of eggs. The standard mint and chocolate liqueur flavorings can be replaced with more affordable food coloring or with actual mint, which can be used to infuse the heavy cream with flavor.

Ballokume Elbasani,"Made with only cornflour, butter, sugar, and eggs, ballokume Elbasani is a simple cookie traditionally prepared for Dita e Verës, an Albanian national holiday celebrated annually on the 14th of March. The preparation, which is quite lengthy as its all done by hand only, is done in a copper bowl and with the help of a wooden spoon, which is the traditional way of doing it that ensures that the dough is as silky and smooth as possible. First, the butter and sugar are mixed by hand until pale and doubled in volume, and then, eggs are added one by one and mixed in after each addition. Lastly, the cornflour is added in batches, and the resulting mass is portioned out using a spoon and arranged on a baking tray. The cookies are baked at a medium temperature.

Italian Academy Of Cuisine'S Minestrone,"Some basic skills with a knife, seasonal vegetables, and a large pot — these three things are all you need for preparing minestrone, a hearty, rich and nutritious Italian soup. In fact, minestrone is often viewed as a legitimate option for lunch or dinner, especially when paired with some quality Italian bread and a glass of wine. The beauty of minestrone lies in the fact that it does not have a set list of ingredients — it changes depending on the season. Still, most recipes do include onions, carrots, celery, tomatoes and legumes, such as beans or peas. The process starts with chopping the vegetables into pieces of similar size, usually into cubes. The next step is to choose one of the two available techniques. One is a crudo, which is tossing the raw vegetables into the water, then gently simmering them until they are fully cooked. The other is col soffritto, meaning the vegetables — and optionally bacon — will first be sautéed with some olive oil, lard or butter, and then boiled in water or stock. Legumes, such as peas and beans, can be used fresh, especially during spring and summer. If dried legumes are used, they need to be soaked in water before cooking, preferably overnight. Herbs and more delicate vegetables, such as zucchini, can be added later during cooking so they do not fall apart. The dense texture of the minestrone is achieved thanks to the ingredients rich in starch, such as potatoes, beans, rice or pasta. Usually, minestrone is cooked on low to medium heat for 40 to 50 minutes and is finished when all the vegetables become tender, but not overcooked. Rice is added 20 minutes before the end of cooking, while small pasta varieties are ready in 5 to 10 minutes, depending on their shape and size. Garnished with a drizzle of olive oil and a handful of grated Parmesan cheese, a bowl of minestrone is ready to be served.","Italy, Europe",4.3,"['50g (1.75 oz) ground lard', '1 celery stick', '2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil', '1 onion, medium', '100g (3.5 oz) beans', '100g (3.5 oz) fresh maize', '100g (3.5 oz) wheat', '2 potatoes', '200g (7 oz) peeled tomatoes', 'salt and pepper, to taste']",4 Servings,PREP 10min,COOK 40min,-,READY IN 50min,TasteAtlas,"['Place onion, chopped celery, ground lard and olive oil into a pan.', 'Add 240 ml (2 cups) of hot water.

Dresdner Stollen,"Traditionally prepared for Christmas, this German sweet bread is made with yeasted dough that’s rich in butter and eggs, and is studded with sultanas, currants, chopped almonds, and candied fruits and peels, typically lemon and orange ones. Dried apricots and marzipan paste are also often included, and the dried fruits can be spiked with rum. The dough is usually flavored with lemon zest, but spices such as cinnamon, cardamom, and anise may also be included. The dough is shaped by hand into a loaf that is brushed with butter and dusted with sugar before baking at a moderate temperature. Once baked, the still hot stollen is brushed with butter and dusted generously with powdered sugar. This step can be repeated more than once, though royal icing can also be used instead. Depending on the used ingredients, there are different kinds of stollen. For example, mandelstollen will have at least 20 percent of almonds, and marzipanstollen will have a filling of marzipan paste in the middle, while mohnstollen has a filling made with ground poppy seeds. If the dough has 40% of butter it is named butterstollen, and in case quark is added the dough, we’re talking of quarkstollen. Ideally, stollen should be made a few weeks in advance, so the flavors have time to mellow and mingle.

Larousse Gastronommique'S Basic Consommé,"Patience is the key element in making consommé — this clear soup can be cooked for up to 5 hours, and some observation is required to get the perfect result. The preparation starts with placing a piece of fresh meat, chicken, fish, or game into a large cooking pot filled with water or stock. Additionally, marrow bones can also be used for a richer taste. Various vegetables, such as onions, carrots, leeks, parsley, and garlic are added, along with egg whites whose role is to help gather all the impurities on the surface. After bringing all the ingredients to a boil, the consommé is slowly simmered for 2 to up to 5 hours, depending on if it is prepared with pre-made stock or just water. Stirring is forbidden during this process, but the surface should be skimmed every now and then. When the cooking is finished, the consommé is strained through a dense sieve or a cloth. The final result is a crystal-clear soup packed with flavors, which is usually served at the beginning of a meal, or used as a basis for other soups and dishes.

Hot Cross Buns,"In the United Kingdom, hot cross buns are most commonly consumed during Lent and are a must on Good Friday, when they are prepared and eaten on the same day, as the mark of the end of Lent. The buns are made with an enriched, sweet, and yeasted dough that is studded with raisins and/or currants, and spiced with the so-called mixed spice, typically a combo of cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice. In the past, the cross on the buns was made with a knife, but today, the cross is made with either shortcrust pastry or a mix of flour and water. Crosses made with sugar icing are also quite common in recipes today. Once the cross is applied, the buns are baked and then brushed with, traditionally, a sugar syrup glaze.

Classic Aşure,"There is no such thing as a set recipe for aşure — the number of ingredients can range between seven to around 15, while some sources cite that this number can reach up to 40 ingredients. The preparation starts with soaking the grains and the beans overnight, preferably in separate bowls. The grains are usually wheat, barley, and bulgur, while the beans include white kidney beans, haricot beans, fava beans, and chickpeas. Next, the beans and the grains are cooked separately until softened, after which they are joined in one large bowl and simmered over low heat. Rice, sugar, rehydrated dried fruit, nuts, and flavorings such as orange or lemon zest and rosewater are added during cooking. After the desired consistency is reached — and it can range from liquid to dense, depending on personal preference — aşure is left to cool. Finally, the surface is richly decorated with dried fruit, nuts, cinnamon, pomegranate seeds, pistachios, and aşure is served cold or at room temperature to family, friends, and neighbors.","Turkiye, Asia",4.6,"['50g (1.75 oz) haricot (navy) beans', '50g (1.75 oz) fava beans', '50g (1.75 oz) chickpeas', '115g (4 oz) pot barley, husks removed', '50g (1.75 oz) rice', '115g (4 oz) dried apricots', '50g (1.75 oz) raisins', '50g (1.75 oz) currants', '225g (8 oz) sugar', '2 tbsp cornstarch or rice flour', '150 ml (5.1 fl oz) rosewater', 'GARNISHINGS', '2 tsp cinnamon', '4-5 dried figs', '4-5 dried apricots', '1 tbsp sultanas', '2 tbsp walnuts', 'seeds of 1/2 pomegranate']",12 Servings,PREP 1h,COOK 40min,-,READY IN 1h 40min,TasteAtlas,"['Soak the haricot and the fava beans, the chickpeas, and pot barley overnight, or for at least 6 hours.

The Original Cobb Salad,"Although it started off as an improvisation, Cobb salad is, in fact, an elaborate dish which makes a well-rounded meal, consisting of salad greens, fresh vegetables, eggs, cheese, chicken breasts, bacon, and a vinaigrette dressing. The chicken breasts and the eggs can be prepared in advance: the meat should be cooked, and the eggs hard-boiled. On the other hand, other ingredients must be prepared right before serving. The salad greens (iceberg and romaine lettuce, watercress, and curly endive) are shredded finely and placed on the bottom of a salad bowl or a large serving plate. Diced tomatoes, shredded chicken breasts, chopped bacon and hard boiled eggs are sprinkled on top and followed by chives, grated Roquefort cheese, and a dressing made with water, red wine vinegar, sugar, lemon juice, salt, pepper, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, garlic, olive oil, and salad oil.

Classic Quẩy,"Although it looks simple, this dish is surprisingly tricky to make, mainly because of the lengthy dough resting process and a lot of manual work. Following the recipe is essential, especially when resting the dough. The process starts with mixing the leavening agents — either baking powder and baking soda, or baking soda and baking ammonia — with water, each in their own bowl. The mixtures are then joined with flour, salt, sugar, and water, kneaded briefly, and the dough is left to rest for 20 minutes under a damp cloth or covered with a plastic wrap. The process of kneading and resting is repeated for 3 times overall, after which the dough is rolled out into a flat disc and left to rest for another 2,5 to 4 hours. The dough is then rolled out for one last time, so it is around 1/2 cm thick, and cut into small rectangles. A shallow dent is made on half of these rectangles using a bamboo stick or a chopstick moistened with water. The remaining half of the rectangles are placed on top of the dented ones, so they resemble a sandwich, and finally, another dent is made on top. The joined rectangles are stretched and tossed in hot oil. During frying, quẩy will expand and separate slightly. When they start floating on the surface of the oil and develop a golden brown crust, they should be removed from the oil, drained and served. A well-prepared quẩy should be crispy on the outside and hollow on the inside. In Vietnam, quẩy is most commonly paired with rice porridge (chao ga), soy milk, and pho broth, especially in northern parts of the country.","Vietnam, Asia",4.3,"['500 g all-purpose flour', '1 tsp salt', '1 tbsp sugar', '250-300 ml water', '5 g baking powder', '10 g baking soda', 'oil, for frying']",12 Servings,PREP 5h 30min,COOK 20min,-,READY IN 5h 50min,TasteAtlas,"['Place baking powder and baking soda in two separate bowls.

Classic Kapsalon,"Filling, practical, and influenced by various national cuisines, kapsalon is a perfect example of how culinary traditions from different sides of the world can create a favorite meal. This dish undoubtedly qualifies as fast food, and one portion contains roughly 1800 calories. The preparation of kapsalon starts with preparing potato fries — frieten (Flemish) or patat (Dutch) — which can be deep-fried, oven-baked or made in a fryer. The fries are lightly salted and arranged on the bottom of a disposable metal food container. Then, a portion of shawarma meat is layered on top of the fries. Shawarma is a Middle-Eastern specialty usually made with spiced lamb meat, although the Dutch version rather uses beef, veal, chicken, and even pork. Typically, shawarma is grilled on vertical rotating metal skewers. However, for homemade preparation, it is suggested to cook the meat in a skillet. Next comes the cheese, preferably real Dutch Gouda cheese with a high fat-content, which should be sprinkled over the fries and meat, and baked shortly in the oven, so it melts. To finish, fresh vegetables, such as lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and onion, are scattered on top and the whole thing is drizzled with sauce, either knoflooksaus (garlic sauce) or sambal, a spicy Indonesian sauce. Most Dutch fast food shops sell kapsalon for a reasonable price and offer vegetarian or light varieties made with falafel, fish, or chicken.","Rotterdam, Netherlands",3.2,"['700g (1.5 lbs) potatoes', '500g (1.1 lbs) shawarma meat', '100g (3.5 oz) grated Gouda cheese (mature, 48+)', '1/2 cucumber', '2 tomatoes', '100g (3.5 oz) iceberg lettuce', '100 ml (1/3 cup + 1 tbsp + 1 tsp) garlic sauce', 'sambal sauce, to taste']",4 Servings,PREP 15min,COOK 30min,-,READY IN 45min,TasteAtlas,"['Peel the potatoes, cut them into fries, and place them on a baking dish lined with parchment.

Dorayaki,"Traditional, yet simple, dorayaki is perfect as an afternoon snack, usually enjoyed with a cup of Japanese green tea. It is made up of two sweet and fluffy pancake slices that enclose a red bean filling. The preparation begins with making the batter. Eggs are first whisked with sugar, and then flour with baking soda and milk with honey are added in batches. Often, mirin and soy sauce are also added. Portions of batter are dropped onto a heated non-stick pan and cooked until the surface appears bubbly at which point the pancakes are flipped and cooked for no more than a minute.

Classic Fried Okra,"Nicknamed “the southern popcorn”, fried okra is a simple side dish which can also be served as an appetizer, especially when paired with various sauces or dips. The preparation is simple and rather quick. First, you will need to choose fresh okra pods, preferably under 3-4 inches in length, since smaller okra pods tend to be softer and less chewy than the larger ones. The stem and the tips are cut off, and the pods are sliced into 1/2-inch-thick pieces. Then, okra slices can be dipped either in flour, beaten eggs, and cornmeal, or coated in buttermilk and a mixture of flour and cornmeal. Various seasonings, such as salt, pepper, and ground red paprika, may be added to the coating mixture. Okra is most commonly fried in oil preheated to 350-375˚F, but the oil may be substituted with lard or mixed with bacon trimmings. The frying is done in a Dutch oven or a cast-iron skillet and is usually done in smaller batches to prevent the okra from sticking. After fried okra has been drained on paper towels, it is sprinkled with salt and served warm.","Oklahoma, United States Of America",4.3,"['12 small okra pods', '1/2 cup all-purpose flour', '1 large egg, beaten', '1/2 cup cornmeal', '1/2 tsp salt', '2 cups peanut oil']",6 Servings,PREP 10min,COOK 30min,-,READY IN 40min,TasteAtlas,"['When choosing okra pods for this recipe, go for the smaller, tender pods under 4 inches in length.

Other additions may include ginger, chilis, cauliflowers, shredded cabbage or anything else you may have at hand. This dish is as tasty hot as it is cold, because, like many other relishes, it develops its full flavor through time.

Chakalaka is most commonly served at South African barbecues called braais paired with grilled meat and sausages. Otherwise, it can be paired with bread, maize porridge mieliepap, roughly chopped corn kernel porridge pap, curries and various stews.

Navajo Frybread,"This staple Native American dish is traditionally made with only five ingredients — flour, baking powder, powdered milk, salt, and water are mixed together and kneaded into a smooth, soft dough, which is then divided into small fist- or egg-sized balls. These dough balls are then patted or stretched by hand into disks, usually only 1/4 to 1/2-inch (0.6 to 1.25 cm) thick. They are then shallow-fried or deep-fried until golden on both sides and are then placed on paper towels to drain. An important step is to leave the dough to rest for at least 20 to 30 minutes, either before or after it has been divided into balls. The longer the rest, the better — this will give the frybread a light and fluffy texture. The liquid ingredients are typically added to the dry ones, but some recipes do the opposite. In addition to this basic recipe, oil or lard is also often added, and milk and yeast are sometimes used instead of water and baking powder. Eggs, yogurt, buttermilk, and cornmeal also make frequent appearances in frybread recipes. Frybread is often sweetened by adding pieces of pumpkin, sugar, and spices. It is eaten hot on its own, as a side, or with savory or sweet toppings such as jam, powdered sugar and cinnamon, honey, and butter.

Śledzie W Oleju (Herrings In Oil),"Served on Christmas Eve, during Lent, as a party appetizer or a side dish, Polish śledzie is a versatile dish made with salted herrings pickled in vinegar, oil, sour cream, onion, apples, and spices. Its preparation begins with pre-salted herrings which can be purchased whole (with skin and bones) or filleted. To remove excess salt and pungent smell, the herrings are soaked in cold water for a few hours or overnight, after which they are marinated or pickled. Oil and vinegar are the most traditional options, and they are usually combined with peppercorns, bay leaves, and allspice. However, the pickle can also include a variety of other ingredients such as apples, onions, tomatoes, cucumbers, mushrooms, raisins, prunes, etc. which sometimes leads to crossing the blurry line towards sałatka and surówka — popular Polish salads which can include śledzie. While most śledzie recipes include marinades made with raw ingredients, there is a local variety from northern Poland, namely the Pomeranian area, which places the herring in a marinade made with sautéed onions, tomato, sugar, and spices. This type of dish is known as śledzie po Kaszubsku (Kashubian herrings), and its name was derived from the Kashubians, an ethnic group who inhabited northern Poland before the Slavic arrival. Śledzie from the city of Szczecin in the northern Polish region of West Pomerania was included in the List of Traditional Products of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.","Poland, Europe",4.1,"['8 salted herring fillets', '1 large onion, sliced', '1/2 cup olive or sunflower oil', '3 allspice seeds', '3 peppercorns', '1 bay leaf']",6 Servings,PREP 1h,-,-,READY IN 1h,TasteAtlas,"['Place herring fillets in a bowl of cold water and soak them for one hour.

Ricciarelli Di Siena,"At its basic, the traditional ricciarelli di Siena cookies are made with almonds, egg whites, and sugar. The resulting dough is shaped into lozenges, which are typically placed on a host wafer or rice paper, but that's not a must. A generous dusting of powdered sugar completes the picture, after which the cookies are left to dry — a key step that ensures that cookies end up with a cracked surface once baked. Most common variations include the addition of flavorings such as orange and lemon peel or candied peel. Also, regular almonds can be partially replaced with bitter almonds, while the almond extract is often added to the dough for a more pronounced almond flavor. Usually, sugar syrup is added to the dough, as well as raising agents and flour. However, no matter how prepared they are, ricciarelli di Siena can be eaten still warm, but they are even better the following day, paired with dessert wines, coffee, or white tea.","Siena, Italy",5.0,"['400g almonds, peeled', '100g powdered sugar', '2 egg whites', '1/2 tsp baking powder', '380g sugar', '50g flour', '20 ml water', '1 tsp bitter almond extract', '1 host paper - 21x30cm rectangle', 'powdered sugar, as needed']",40 Servings,PREP 25min,COOK 10min,-,READY IN 35min,TasteAtlas,"['Grind the almonds with 330g of granulated sugar, then mix them in the bowl with a wooden spatula.', 'Use a small saucepan to melt 50g of granulated sugar with the water — stir the mixture and keep the heat low.', 'When the sugar has dissolved, add it to the dough, then mix it with a wooden spatula.', 'Add sifted flour, 50 g of powdered sugar, and the baking powder, then stir with a spatula.', 'Cover the mixture with a clean rag and let it rest in the bowl at room temperature (at least 12 hours).', 'Preheat the oven to 110°C (230°F).', 'Whip the egg whites until the mixture has a texture of foam (use an electric whisk).', 'Gradually add the remaining icing sugar (50 g) and a teaspoon of bitter almond extract.', 'Break the rested dough with the wooden spatula and add the whipped egg whites.', 'Mix gently from the bottom to the top until thoroughly combined.', 'To get a homogeneous mixture, knead the dough with your hands.', 'Roll the dough until you get a loaf 1’’ (2.5 cm) in diameter.', 'Transfer the dough to a surface dusted with icing sugar.', 'Slice into little ovals (each should be about 25 g/0.88 oz).', 'Cover the baking tray with parchment paper.', 'Cut out the host to fit the shape of each cookie and place it under each ricciarello.', 'Arrange the riccarelli in the tray.

Chacarero,"This Chilean sandwich is prepared by slicing open a sandwich bread (originally either marraqueta or frica bread), and filling it with grilled or pan-fried slices of beef steak (either flank steak, cube steak, or sirloin), chopped up chili pepper aji verde, lengthways sliced green beans, and tomatoes. The green beans are typically boiled but can be sautéed instead, and you can use any sandwich or hamburger bread that you have on hand, but in any case, don't forget to heat the bread before you assemble the sandwich. Although purists claim chacarero is made with only these ingredients, mayonnaise (or butter) is often included. In most restaurants, you will be given the option to choose whether or not you would like your sandwich to be made with mayonnaise, and — because it's after all mildly hot — whether or not you would like it to include the aji verde pepper. Variations on the recipe include using pork instead of beef, using mayonnaise or butter, adding slices of cheese, or spreading the bread with avocado.

Initially, at McDonald’s chicken nuggets came with three dipping sauces from which you could choose — barbecue, sweet-sour and hot mustard — but the repertoire has since expanded to include many more.

Fudge,"Fudge is a soft, creamy candy made with sugar, butter, and milk, which are heated and cooked until soft ball stage (from 112 to 116°C/234 to 240°F). The blend is then removed from the stove and, once chilled a bit, beaten to acquire smooth consistency. Next, the mixture is poured into a pan and left to cool completely before cutting. Marshmallow cream or sweetened condensed milk are frequently incorporated into the batter to speed up the preparation process since they reduce the amount of beating required when assembling the treat. Fudge is a crystalline candy. The key to making a successful batch is controlling the crystallization of the supersaturated sugar solution. Miniature crystals of sugar are responsible for its solid but creamy consistency. There are many variations on the basic recipe, mostly in the form of using supplementary ingredients, such as chocolate, caramel, fruits, nuts, and candies. The Americans love their fudge with the addition of peanut butter, whereas the Brits enjoy the dessert supplemented with clotted cream or rum and raisins. Penuche is a brown sugar variety commonly associated with the American South and New England, whereas versions of the dessert also appear in Scotland and England's Midlands region. Fudge is usually served cut into squares.","Baltimore, United States Of America",3.9,"['4 oz (120g) chocolate', '2 cups (400g) sugar', '1 tsp vanilla', '1/2 cup (120 ml) milk', '1 tbsp butter, heaping']",16 Servings,PREP 10min,COOK 10min,RESTING 4h,READY IN 4h 20min,TasteAtlas,"['Melt the sugar, chocolate, milk and butter in a saucepan over heat.

Academia Barilla'S Grissini,"Long and thin, these Italian breadsticks are not only a great nibble before any meal but are also visually attractive — to turn into a table centerpiece, they require only to be placed in a large glass or a vase. Hand-rolled, and easily recognized by their knotted surface, robatà breadsticks, also known as rustica, are the older and more traditional varietal of grissini that varies in length from 40 to 80 cm. Stirà ones, however, are made by hand pulling a piece of dough to arm’s length which makes for an even crispier grissini. Either lard or olive oil is added to the dough made with flour, water, salt, and sugar, but for those calorie-conscious grissini can also be prepared with water only. The dough is typically twice proved, then cut up into strips that are either rolled or stretched to the desired length. The grissini are then arranged on a semolina-dusted baking tray and baked until golden and crisp, but the rule is that, although baked grissini should have a crunchy texture the insides should retain a bit of chewiness. To add variety to the basic recipe, one can add ingredients like tomatoes, caramelized onions, herbs, and olives to the dough or sprinkle various seeds over the prepared dough sticks before baking. Grissini makes for a great appetizer, typically wrapped in ham and other cold cuts or paired with different cheeses, and alternatively, can also be served as a side to soups or stews.","Turin, Italy",4.6,"['1 ½ lb wheat flour', '¼ cup extra virgin olive oil', '½ oz salt', '¾ oz fresh yeast', '1 2/3 cups water', 'durum wheat flour to taste']",6 Servings,PREP 1h,COOK 15min,-,READY IN 1h 15min,TasteAtlas,"['Mound the flour on the working surface, make a small well in the middle of it and add to it, olive oil, salt, yeast, and water.

Basic Rahat Lokum,"One of the hallmarks of Turkish cuisine, rahat lokum — also known as lokum or Turkish delight — is a delicate, jelly-like dessert which comes in a variety of colors and flavors. It is usually shaped into bite-sized cubes, although it can be rolled and cut into slices, or shaped into small balls. Typically, rahat lokum is prepared by combining cornstarch, water, sugar, and lemon juice in a cooking pot and bringing them to a boil, after which the heat is reduced to low, and the mixture is stirred constantly until it thickens. Then, the lokum mixture is removed from heat and enriched with flavorings, food colorings, and additions. Flavorings typically include rose water, orange blossom water or fruit juice and are mandatory. On the other hand, using food coloring and additional ingredients such as nuts and fruit is completely optional. The rahat lokum mixture is poured into a baking pan lined with plastic wrap and left to thicken completely. Finally, it is cut and rolled into a mixture of cornstarch and powdered sugar, desiccated coconut, or ground or chopped nuts. Although it is quite sweet, it is believed that a good lokum can be recognized by the fact that it will not make you thirsty. The fact that it comes in thousands of variants guarantees that everyone can find a kind that suits their taste perfectly.","Istanbul, Turkiye",4.3,"['25 g icing sugar', '100 g cornstarch (divided: 25 g + 75 g)', '700 g caster sugar', 'juice of 1 lemon', '500 ml water (divided: 400 ml + 100 ml)', '3 tbsp powdered gelatin', 'red or pink coloring, optional', '2 tbsp rose water']",12 Servings,PREP 15min,COOK 25min,-,READY IN 40min,TasteAtlas,"['Start by lining an 8x8-inch baking tin with plastic wrap.', 'Sift 25 g of cornstarch and icing sugar into a small bowl and combine.

Pumpkin Pie,"To get the filling, pumpkin purée, spices, sugar, and evaporated milk are added to beaten eggs, which is then poured into a pie shell typically made of shortcrust pastry. The assembled pie is baked for 40-50 minutes and when done, left to cool for a couple of hours after which it's served topped with whipped cream. Today, the use of store-bought cans of pumpkin purée is commonplace, but of course, a purée made from scratch is no doubt of superior taste. The spices used most often are cinnamon, cloves, and ginger; however, nutmeg and allspice are also called for in recipes, while mace is listed only in older recipes for pumpkin pie.

Pound Cake,"A pound of flour, a pound of sugar, a pound of butter, and a pound of eggs — that, in short, is the pound cake. Because there are no leavening agents in a true pound cake, it is essential to cream the butter with sugar very well and to whip the eggs properly — this is crucial since it incorporates air into the batter which helps the cake rise. Although simple, this cake is incredibly versatile and can hold any flavor imaginable, from spices like mace, cinnamon, and cloves, to dried fruits. Modern iterations of the recipe will include raising agents which will produce a lighter cake. Commonly a part of butter or all of it is replaced with oil which results in a more moist cake. Proportions of the ingredients can also vary depending on the recipe, and the use of sour cream in place of butter is quite common. Pound cake is usually baked in either a round, a loaf or a bundt pan and is commonly served dusted with sugar, glazed or iced.","United Kingdom, Europe",3.9,"['1 lb (450g) sugar (2 cups)', '1 lb (450g) butter, room temperature', '1 lb (450g) flour, sifted with salt (4 cups before sifting)', '1 dozen eggs', '1⁄4 tsp salt', '1⁄4 cup (60 ml) fresh lemon juice', '1 tbsp fresh lemon rind, grated']",24 Servings,PREP 25min,COOK 1h 30min,-,READY IN 1h 55min,TasteAtlas,"['Set the oven to preheat to 325°F/160°C.', 'First, cream the butter with sugar until pale and fluffy, then start adding the eggs one by one, beating after each addition.', 'Add the flour in batches, a ½ cup at a time.', 'Lastly, add the lemon rind and the lemon juice.', 'Pour the batter into an oiled and floured loaf pan.', 'Bake for 75-90 minutes — the cake is done when a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.']",https://www.tasteatlas.com/pound-cake/recipe,-
Banana Cream Pie,"A diner classic, cream pie is perhaps the easiest of American desserts to prepare. A shortcrust pastry made with just flour, butter and sugar is pressed into a pie plate and usually baked at a medium temperature. Once cooled, a custard made with milk, sugar, yolks, eggs, and cream is poured into a pie shell and topped with whipped cream. Alternatively, the crust can be made with anything from wafers, chocolate cookies, even sugar cones, and cornflakes, while the standard vanilla custard, depending on the recipe, can be additionally flavored and decorated with, for example, coconut, chocolate, or bananas. Meringue can be used as topping instead of whipped cream in which case it must be baked. Coconut cream pie, as well as banana cream pie, are the most popular kinds, with chocolate cream pie coming in close second.

Classic Grits,"One of the most characteristic breakfast dishes of the American South, grits are essentially a porridge made from dried, hulled and ground corn kernels cooked in water or other liquid, and seasoned with salt and butter. White, yellow, or blue corn can be used, and the process starts with hominy, dried corn kernels from which the hull has been removed by soaking them in water mixed with lime mineral, wood ash, or other alkaline products. Dried and ground hominy is called hominy grits, or simply grits, and it is available in four varieties. Whole-ground or stone-ground grits are the coarsest, regular grits are medium ground, quick grits are ground finely, while instant grits have the finest texture. As a dish, grits are usually prepared in heavy-based cooking pans, either in salted water or other liquids such as milk, cream, or chicken stock. The cooking is done slowly, over low heat, stirring constantly, until the texture becomes creamy and thick. Whole-ground grits need to be cooked for 40 to 60 minutes, while instant grits can be prepared in a matter of seconds just by adding boiling water. Typically, a chunk of butter is stirred in at the very end, while other seasonings and additions include pepper and paprika, cheese, bacon, or eggs. Although it is primarily a breakfast dish, grits is an essential part of another Southern US specialty called shrimp and grits, which is a popular dinner entrée. Finally, grits shouldn’t be confused with polenta as grits are made from flint or dent corn varieties whose kernels have had their hull removed, while polenta, typically made in Italy, is made from another corn variety called field corn, and the hull is left intact.","Southern United States, United States Of America",4.4,"['1 cup hominy (grits)', '4 cups water', '2 tsp salt', '1 small lump butter or 1/2 cup milk or thin cream', 'a small piece of lard or cooking oil']",4 Servings,-,COOK 1h,-,READY IN 1h,TasteAtlas,"['Grease a large pot with a small piece of lard or with some cooking oil.', 'Pour in the water, bring it to a boil, and then add salt.', 'Pour the hominy (grits) into the salted water.

The preparation starts with extracting as much juice from the fruit, then boiling some of the juice with sugar until it turns into a syrup. A thickener is added next, usually, potato starch which has been previously dissolved in water, and the syrup is stirred until it thickens.

Traditional Reims Pain D’Épices,"This delicacy, whose name directly translates as spiced bread”, is made with rye flour, wheat flour, or a combination of the two. There are as many variations of the recipe for pain d’épices as there are regions in France, but the two most famous are the original from Reims, made with dark rye flour and without the addition of milk and eggs, and a version from Dijon made with wheat flour. The most commonly-used spices for pain d’épices are cardamom, cloves, nutmeg, ginger, and anise, the last of which is used especially in the Dijon version, while the Reims version always requires at least a pinch of cinnamon. Orange and lemon zest are also added in other regional variants of the recipe. Honey is the most important part of the recipe, and the variety of honey used should, therefore, be carefully chosen, as its aroma will dominate the taste of the bread. Many recipes suggest that rich kinds of honey like pine honey work best. Le Syndicat des Biscuits et Gâteaux de France has reserved the name pain d’épices pur miel for bread sweetened only with honey, as many cooks today add sugar in addition to honey.

Juane De Gallina,"Juane is a traditional delicacy hailing from the Peruvian Amazon, typically consisting of seasoned rice and chicken wrapped in bijao leaves, the type of juane known as juane de gallina. The recipe starts with preparing the rice, which is combined with seasoned vegetables and, in some cases, beaten eggs. This richly seasoned rice is then laid out on a large bijao leaf, and one seasoned and browned chicken leg is positioned vertically in the center of the rice. Additionally, often, half a hard-boiled egg and an olive are set atop the rice as well. The leaf is then folded around this filling, creating a neat packet, which is subsequently secured with string. Finally, these packets are cooked or steamed until the ingredients inside fuse and the leaves infuse the parcel with flavor. However, Peru's rich culinary diversity has given rise to multiple variations of this classic dish. The sarajuane, for instance, swaps out the rice for a rich blend of ground raw peanuts, corn, and chicken broth. The juane de yuca has ground yucca and fish as ingredients. The juane de chonta introduces the slightly nutty and crunchy texture of chopped chonta, also known as hearts of palm, to the rice mixture. For meat lovers, the avispajuane is a treat, containing ground pork in the rice and pieces of fried chicken. In contrast, the ninajuane moves away from rice entirely and instead mixes pieces of chicken with beaten egg, while chunchullijuane uses chicken giblets instead of standard chicken. And lastly, there is poroto juane, which features ground ""puspo poroto"" beans instead of rice with a chicken piece at the center. Juane is typically served with fried plantain and cocona and chili salsa but also plantain mash tacacho, cassava, or boiled bananas.","San Martín, Peru",3.8,"['FOR RICE', '2 garlic cloves', '500g (1.1 lbs) rice', '750 ml (3 cups) beef stock', 'FOR JUANE', '4 chicken legs', '1/2 tbsp salt', '1/2 tbsp pepper', '1/2 tbsp cumin', '1 tbsp butter', '1 onion', '4 garlic cloves', '2 tbsp turmeric', '4 tomatoes', '1/2 tbsp oregano', '2 laurel leaves', '2 bunches of sacha culantro (jungle cilantro) – use cilantro as substitute', '5 aji dulce (small sweet chili peppers) – use other types of chili as substitute or bell peppers for no spice', '250 ml (1 cup) beef stock', 'salt and pepper, to taste', '4 eggs (to beat)', '2 boiled eggs', '4 bijao leaves – you can find these in Latin American supermarkets or substitute with banana leaves or foil', 'olives']",4 Servings,PREP 1h,COOK 2h,-,READY IN 3h,TasteAtlas,"['In a large sauté pan, begin by heating vegetable oil.

The Original 1953 Coronation Chicken,"Created for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, coronation chicken or poulet reine Elizabeth is a cold dish consisting of poached and shredded chicken slathered in a mayonnaise-based, curry-flavored sauce. Originally it was served on one side of an oblong dish with a side of rice salad on the other. The rice salad is made with cooked rice, cooked peas, diced raw cucumber, and finely chopped mixed herbs, all combined with a seasoned French dressing. However, coronation chicken has lost much of its grandeur over the years, becoming a cafeteria staple and a sandwich filling.

Escoffier'S Recipe For Pêche Melba,"Peach Melba is a simple fruit dessert created by the legendary Auguste Escoffier. It is made with ripe peaches, vanilla ice cream, and a purée made with fresh raspberries. The first version was allegedly created in 1894 and came served in a swan carved out of a block of ice (pêches au cygne). In the center, the chef placed a silver cup filled with vanilla ice cream and topped it with poached and chilled peaches. He then decorated his creation with spun sugar. Escoffier allegedly first made the dessert for the renowned Australian singer Helen Porter Mitchell, who was better known as Dame Nellie Melba. It is believed that the dessert got its final form, which included the raspberry sauce, as well as the current name (pêche Melba), several years later when Escoffier worked at the London’s Ritz Carlton Hotel.

Michetta,"Characterized by a bulged exterior, hollow insides, and a shape reminiscent of a flower or a star, michetta is one of the key gastronomic symbols of Milano, along with ossobucco alla Milanese, panettone, cassoeula, and many more. The preparation is a lengthy one, and a few rules have to be followed to get the desired outcome. The first phase is making what Italians call biga, a pre-ferment consisting of flour, yest, and water that has to rest anywhere from 16 to 20 hours in a cold place. The second phase takes place the following day when flour, water, malt, and salt are added to biga, making sure the salt is added last. Once well kneaded and rested, the dough is to be divided into balls ranging between 50 and 90 grams. Each piece is then passed through a pasta machine three times. After each time, the dough should be rolled into a bun and left to rest, covered, for 10 to 30 minutes. Lastly, a mold is pressed into each piece of dough which are then baked in a 240-260°C steam oven.

The dark tea that is often included in recipes is used to rehydrate the dried fruit overnight and to provide moisture to the cake, although recipes that include no tea get their moisture from milk and water. Other typical ingredients include butter and lard, molasses, spices, honey, marmalade, fruit juice, candied fruit peel, and salt. Whiskey can also be added, if desired.

White Cupacakes,"This delightful handheld dessert owes much of its widespread success to the simplicity of its ingredients and its easy preparation. The basic ingredients for cupcake batter are butter, sugar, eggs, flour, milk, and a leavening agent such as baking soda.

Classic Meatloaf,"A dish firmly labeled as a homemade specialty, meatloaf is a popular, economic and, most of all, versatile way of preparing ground meat. Most common meat choices include beef, veal, pork, and turkey, which are expanded with milk-soaked bread crumbs and bound together with eggs. Very often, the meat is enriched with sautéed onions, garlic, celery, and carrots, which help retain moisture. Filling the meatloaf is also a popular option, and usually includes hard boiled eggs, spinach, bacon, cheese, peppers, dried fruit, spinach and other leafy vegetables such as spinach or Swiss chard. The ingredients are combined by hand in a large bowl and seasoned at the very end with salt, pepper, paprika, powdered garlic, and herbs. Next, the mixture is formed into a shape of a log or placed into a loaf baking pan and baked at 350˚F for 60 to 75 minutes. Classic American recipes often suggest glazing the meatloaf with ketchup and serving it with mashed potatoes and green beans. The ideal meatloaf is tender, moist and spongy, and makes for a perfect sandwich filling the next day.","United States Of America, North America",3.9,"['1 cup fresh breadcrumbs', '1/3 cup whole milk', '1 medium onion', '1 celery stalk', '4 garlic cloves', '2 tbsp vegetable oil', '2 ¼ tsp kosher salt, divided', '1 ½ tsp freshly ground black pepper, divided', '3 tbsp Worcestershire sauce', '1 ½ lb ground beef chuck, preferably 20% fat', '1/2 lb ground pork', '2 large eggs', '1/2 cup ketchup, divided, plus more for serving']",8 Servings,PREP 35min,COOK 1h 15min,-,READY IN 1h 50min,TasteAtlas,"['Preheat the oven to 350˚F and adjust the rack to a central position.

Grechnevaya Kasha – Buckwheat Porridge,"When it comes to Russian cuisine, kasha is rightfully considered a staple food, holding the second place on the most beloved dish list right after shchi — cabbage soup. This fact is proved by an old Russian saying: “Shchi da kasha – pishcha nasha”, meaning “Shchi and kasha are our kind of food”. Kasha is actually a nutritious porridge made with cereals or pseudocereals, which can be served for breakfast, dinner, as a side dish usually paired with soup or an individual meal. The beauty of kasha is in its versatility — it can be sweet or savory, and as simple or complex as desired. Typically, the preparation of kasha starts with rinsing and soaking the cereals (buckwheat, millet, rice, wheat or oat), cooking them in water, milk or even broth and seasoning with either salt or sugar. Usually, the ratio between cereals and liquid is 1:2, and the cooking time depends on the type of cereals used. Other than cereals, roughly ground flours such as semolina and cornmeal can also be used. The density of kasha can be adjusted to taste — crumbly porridge is most commonly served as a garnish, while liquid porridge called razmazanya is a usual breakfast option, especially when it is made with milk. Kasha is often topped with butter, and other additions include fresh or dried fruit and vegetables, nuts, eggs, ham, bacon, eggs, cheese, spices, honey and even chocolate. The trick for a perfect kasha lies in cooking it slowly, without stirring (with the exception on flour-based varieties), preferably in a cast-iron skillet. Some recipes suggest placing the boiled kasha in a hot oven so it develops a crust, and the dish is regularly served hot.","Russia, Europe",3.3,"['1 cup buckwheat groats', '2 cups water', 'salt to taste', '30 g vegetable oil', 'butter to taste']",2 Servings,-,COOK 15min,-,READY IN 15min,TasteAtlas,"['Wash buckwheat groats several times or under running water.', 'Transfer them to an adequate-sized pot, and cover with water.', 'Add salt and vegetable oil.

Classic Ranch Dressing,"Creamy, herby, and simple to make, ranch sauce is by far the most popular salad dressing in the USA. However, it is also commonly used as a dip for chips, fried foods, and vegetables, or as a condiment in burgers, pizzas, and sandwiches. Although there are many industrial versions available, ranch dressing can easily be prepared at home. Mayonnaise, buttermilk, and sometimes sour cream are whisked in a bowl, while fresh onions and garlic are crushed into a paste with some salt. Alternatively, powdered garlic and onion can also be used. Fresh or dried herbs, typically chives, parsley, and dill, are stirred in, and to finish, the dressing is seasoned with salt, pepper, and mustard. Ranch dressing should be refrigerated before serving and can keep for a week if stored in an air-tight container.","Santa Barbara, United States Of America",4.0,"['1/2 cup mayonnaise', '1/2 cup buttermilk', '1 clove garlic', '1 tbsp onion', '1/8 tsp fine sea salt', '1/2 tsp dry mustard', '2 tbsp fresh chives', '1 tbsp fresh flat-leaf parsley', '1 tbsp fresh dill', '1/4 tsp ground black pepper']",2 Servings,PREP 20min,-,-,READY IN 20min,TasteAtlas,"['Combine mayonnaise and buttermilk in a small bowl.', 'Peel the garlic and chop the onion finely.

Salisbury Steak,"This dish is made from ground beef that has been seasoned with salt and pepper, shaped into a patty, and cooked over low to moderate heat until browned on both sides.

Game Meat Terrine,"A close relative of pâté, the term terrine denotes both the dish and the earthenware vessel in which it is cooked. The preparation starts with lining the mold with fatback, which is the traditional choice, but today, the preferred option of many chefs is either ham, prosciutto, bacon, spinach, and even seaweed. However, often recipes call for no liners or use plastic wrap instead. To prepare, the meats, and sometimes fish and/or vegetables, which have been previously roughly chopped are mixed together with garnishings and put on top of the chosen liner, which is then folded over the mixture, and the assembled terrine is covered with a tight-fitting lid and baked in a water bath. Once cooked, the terrine is weighed down with a heavy object, and when cooled, stored in the refrigerator for two to three days, so all the flavors can develop and mature. For serving, the terrine is unmolded and cut into slices which are eaten as an entrée with bread and perhaps a salad.","France, Europe",4.1,"['2 kg (4.4 lbs) game meat (deer or wild boar) boneless', '2 shallots', '1 carrot', '12 juniper berries', '1 L (4 cups + 4 tbsp) dry white wine', '3 tbsp of Armagnac', '1 bouquet garni', '2 slices of bacon', '350g (12.3 oz) sausage meat', '200g (7 oz) ground veal', 'salt', 'pepper']",8 Servings,PREP 40min,COOK 2h,RESTING 2d 0h,READY IN 2d 2h,TasteAtlas,"['Cut the game meat into thin strips.

Grilled Peanut Butter And Jelly Sandwich,"To prepare, all that is needed is to spread one bread slice with peanut butter, and the other with fruit jelly, then sandwich the bread slices, so the spreads are in the middle. The bread of choice is soft, white bread, which can be toasted, or replaced with French toast, banana bread, and sourdough or similar artisan-style breads. The most popular fruit jellies are strawberry and grape, but any kind can be used to make the sandwich. Slices of fruit and honey can also be used instead, and some recipes even include applewood-smoked bacon in place of jelly. The fluffernutter, a sandwich in its own right, is a variation of the PB&J sandwich, with marshmallow fluff instead of jelly. For more flavor and texture, the sandwich can be grilled or fried, usually after it's been dipped in eggs and cereal coating.","United States Of America, North America",3.0,"['2 tsp butter', '1 tsp peanut butter', '2 tsp any flavor fruit jelly', '2 slices white bread']",1 Serving,PREP 5min,COOK 8min,-,READY IN 13min,TasteAtlas,"['Heat a griddle or a skillet to 175°C.', 'Spread one side of each bread slice with butter, then spread the unbuttered side of one bread slice with peanut butter, and spread the unbuttered side of the other bread slice with jelly.', 'Sandwich the two slices, so the peanut butter and jelly are in the middle.', 'Grill for about 4 minutes per side.']",https://www.tasteatlas.com/peanut-butter-and-jelly-sandwich/recipe,-
Mince Pie,"Mince pie is a classic sweet pie that has been commonly enjoyed during the Christmas season in most of the English-speaking world for centuries. Mince pie consists of a soft and crumbly shortcrust pastry shell and a gorgeously aromatic filling (mincemeat) made with various dried fruits, spices, and spirits. Unlike traditional shortcrust pastry, mince pies are made with a bit more butter, which gives the pastry an even softer and richer texture. Initially, the filling included minced meat, and the pie was rectangularly shaped to resemble the manger Jesus had been laid in. Today, mince pies are bite-sized snacks typically made without meat, but suet (hard beef or mutton fat) still plays a vital role in preparing the filling. Much like with confit, once hardened, suet creates a protective layer that helps preserve the mincemeat for a very long time. Thanks to mincemeat’s commercial availability, preparing mince pies has become a fairly quick and simple process; granted, homemade mincemeat is yet to find its commercial match. What is beautiful about mince pies is that they are an incredibly versatile dish that can be sweet and savory, meatatarian or vegetarian, yet equally delicious in all forms. Once baked, mince pies are traditionally dusted with icing sugar and served with a dollop of brandy butter (hard sauce).","England, Europe",4.1,"['FOR THE PASTRY', '2 cups + 3 tbsp (350g) all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting the work surface', '1 cup (225g) unsalted butter (or an equal mix of butter and lard), cold and cubed', '1 pinch salt', '1 egg, beaten', 'cold water, as needed', 'MINCEMEAT', '3 oz (90g) raisins', '2 oz (55g) dried currants', '2 oz (55g) candied mixed peel, finely chopped', '3 oz (90g) suet (shredded, beef, or vegetarian)', '1/4 lb (115g) dark brown sugar', '1/4 tsp freshly grated nutmeg', '1 tsp mixed spice', '1/2 lemon, grated zest and juice', '1/2 orange, grated zest and juice', '1/2 apple (Bramley or cooking apple), cored and finely chopped', '2 tbsp brandy', 'DUSTING', ""2 tbsp confectioners' sugar""]",12 Servings,PREP 40min,COOK 2h 50min,RESTING 3h,READY IN 6h 30min,TasteAtlas,"['One day in advance, make the mincemeat by combining all the ingredients (except the brandy) in a large baking dish.

Classic Zenzai,"A type of shiruko or oshiruko, a traditional Japanese dessert, zenzai is a simple dish which can be enjoyed hot or cold, depending on the region and the season. It is made with boiled sweet red azuki beans and sweet rice cakes called mochi or glutinous rice flour dumplings dango. The preparation is rather simple, but it may take some time, depending on the basic ingredient. If zenzai is made with dried red azuki beans, they need to be cooked until they become completely soft, which can take up to 2 hours. Canned azuki beans take shorter to cook, and the quickest way to prepare zenzai is to dilute anko — sweet red bean paste which can be coarse or smooth. Hence, the texture of zenzai can vary — it can look like a dense soup with whole red beans in it; the beans can be partially smashed, or puréed completely. The version with puréed beans is most commonly enjoyed in eastern Japan, where zenzai goes by the name of shiruko or oshiruko and has a thinner consistency than regular zenzai. The bean soup is typically sweetened with white or brown sugar and garnished with grilled mochi or dango. As a contrast to its sweetness, zenzai is often served with pickled plums or salty seaweed.","Japan, Asia",2.2,"['1 cup red azuki beans', '1 ½ cup sugar', '1 ½ cup sugar', 'salt', '6 mochi']",6 Servings,-,COOK 2h 30min,-,READY IN 2h 30min,TasteAtlas,"['Place red beans and 4 to 5 cups of water in a pot.

Popara,"A way to transform stale bread into an edible dish that can feed an entire family, popara is a kind of a bread mash that is typically very frugal, consisting only of stale bread, some liquid, usually water, fat — either oil, butter, or lard — and salt. With time, however, additional ingredients began to be added to make it more flavorful and satiable, like fried onions, sour cream, and cheese. Although typically a savory dish, there is also a sweet version of popara. In any case, the preparation is rather simple. Stale bread which has been diced or thorn by hand is poured over with hot water — milk or tea can be used as well — to which oil, butter, or lard have been added, and seasoned with salt.

Cantonese-Style Mooncakes With Lotus Seed Paste And Salted Egg Yolks,"An elaborate Chinese dessert, mooncake is quite a challenge even for the most experienced cooks. Its preparation requires time and patience, especially when it comes to assembling. The first step is to choose the filling, which can be sweet or savory. The most popular fillings include lotus seed paste, various bean pastes, mixed nuts, sesame seed paste, while pork is a favorite in the savory department. Salted duck egg yolk is often incorporated into the middle of a mooncake and has a strong symbolic meaning. The sweet fillings are made by soaking, cooking, and mashing the beans and seeds, which are then cooked in a pan with sugar, oil or butter, and a little salt, so the liquid evaporates, and the paste becomes dry and dough-like. The dough, on the other hand, is made by kneading flour with fat (traditionally lard, nowadays vegetable oil), lye water, and inverted sugar syrup or honey. The following steps are all about precision. The dough and the fillings are precisely divided into individual portions and weighed carefully, so each mooncake is identical to the other. The dough is then wrapped around a filling to form a small ball. The mooncakes get their final shape by being pressed in wooden or plastic mooncake molds. Elaborate imprints on the top usually contain Chinese characters for harmony or longevity or depict a moon, a rabbit, flowers, and other designs with symbolic significance. Finally, once assembled, mooncakes are baked for 20-25 minutes, but they need to be stored in an airtight container for 1-2 days to become moist and soft enough to eat. Usually, they are served during the Mid-Autumn Festival, dedicated to the mythical Moon Goddess, and they are considered a beautiful and sophisticated present for business partners and respected relatives.","Guangdong, China",3.1,"['FOR LOTUS SEED PASTE', '150g (5.3 oz) dried lotus seeds', '120g (4.2 oz) caster sugar', '80g (2.8 oz) vegetable oil', '1/2 tsp salt', 'FOR DOUGH', '180g (6.3 oz) plain flour', '125g (4.4 oz) honey', '1/8 tsp (0,5g) dietary alkali', '55g (2 oz) groundnut oil', 'FOR FILLING', '20 salted eggs', 'FOR EGG WASH', '1 egg yolk', '1 tbsp egg white']",20 Servings,PREP 40min,COOK 2h 35min,RESTING 2d 12h,READY IN 2d 15h,TasteAtlas,"['First, prepare the lotus seeds by soaking them in water for 6-8 hours.

Lombard Torrone From Cremona,"Present in every corner of Italy, the Italian nougat or torrone usually comes in the form of bars and is made with honey, sugar, egg whites, and toasted nuts, usually almonds, hazelnuts, and pistachio. Its texture can range from soft and chewy (torrone morbido or torrone tenero), to hard and brittle (torrone duro), which is determined by the length of cooking. Apart from the basic ingredients, the torrone can also include chocolate, dried or candied fruit, orange or lemon zest, other nuts such as walnuts or sesame seeds, and glucose syrup. The preparation is simple, but in most cases, quite time-consuming. The first step is to toast the nuts, which can be left whole or chopped coarsely. Honey and sugar are melted in separate bowls over a bain-marie — the honey should become liquid, while the sugar should be brought to the point of caramelization. The honey and sugar syrup are then joined, mixed with whipped egg whites and preferred nuts, and cooked. Cooking may last from just a few minutes to up to 8 hours, depending on the recipe, and the mixture needs to be stirred constantly. Then, the torrone mixture is poured into a special rectangular wooden mold or a non-stick baking dish lined with edible wafer paper ostia, which is used to prevent future torrone bars from sticking. Alternatively, torrone can be shaped without a mold on a marble slab with the help of a rolling pin or a metal spatula. The hot mixture is flattened, so it's 1 to 3 cm high, and covered with another sheet of wafer paper. After being cooled slightly, the torrone is cut into pieces of the desired size — which can range from long rectangular bars to small, bite-sized cubes — and left to cool completely. Since it is rich in sugar, which serves as a preserving agent, torrone can keep for months but should be stored in an air-tight container and kept in a cool place. When it comes to regional varieties, the possibilities are endless. Probably the most famous version of torrone comes from the city of Cremona in the northern-Italian region of Lombardy, where it is made with almonds, honey, sugar syrup, and egg whites, and can be found in both varieties — soft and hard. The neighboring region Piedmont is known for the use of hazelnuts in their torrone, especially in the cities of Alba, Asti, and Cuneo. On the other hand, the Veneto region has its own name for the torrone — mandorlato — which suggests that the preferred nut is the almond. Central Italian regions, particularly Tuscany, Marche, and Abruzzo, opt for a soft torrone: the Tuscan variety often includes dried fruit, while in Abruzzo chocolate is added to the mixture. If we go further south, it is noticeable that the egg whites tend to be omitted from the recipes. For instance, in the city of Naples in Campania, torrone is made with chocolate and hazelnuts and is traditionally prepared for the All Saints Day in honor of the deceased, carrying a macabre name torrone dei morti (lit. torrone of the dead). Despite its deceptive name, the Calabrese torrone gelato doesn’t include any ice cream, but it is heavily studded with candied fruit and coated with chocolate. Calabria and Sicily share a torrone variety based on sesame seeds called giuggulena. When it comes to Sicilian varieties, there is cubbaita, made with almond and pistachios, and minnulata, made with almonds — and both are enhanced with citrus zest. Although it is most commonly associated with Christmas, the torrone is prepared and enjoyed throughout the year and can be found virtually everywhere — in supermarkets, street markets, fairs, artisanal pastry shops, or as a part of elaborated desserts in fancy restaurants.","Italy, Europe",4.4,"['20 wafer papers', '200 g sugar', '200 g honey', '50 ml water', '500 g hazelnuts or almonds', '1 sachet vanilla sugar', '2 egg whites', 'zest from 1 lemon']",8 Servings,PREP 15min,COOK 1h,-,READY IN 1h 15min,TasteAtlas,"['Mix water with sugar over low heat until it caramelizes.', 'Meanwhile, roast the hazelnuts or almonds.', 'Melt the honey in a bain-marie.

Classic Acar Mentah,"Sweet, salty, and sour at the same time, acar is a simple Indonesian salad made from vegetables and, sometimes, fruit.

Additional ingredients may include peppers, long beans, cabbage, pineapples, and mango. If acar is made with fresh vegetables, it is called acar mentah, meaning raw acar. On the other hand, the vegetables can also be cooked shortly in brine, and, in that case, they are seasoned with turmeric powder, nuts, and other spices.

Leningrad Rassolnik,"Hailed by Russians as the best hangover cure, rassolnik soup, whether made meatless or vegetarian, always has pickles and their brine as the main ingredients. The preparation typically starts with making a meat or a vegetable broth, boiling the innards or giblets (veal, beef, poultry, and lamb) and sautéing or baking the root vegetables. Once the broth has been strained, chopped kidneys or liver (and sometimes meat) are added to it together with vegetables, herbs, and spices. At this point, barley which has been previously soaked in water or boiled is also added to the soup. The staple ingredient of this dish, pickles are chopped and before being added to the soup are either sautéed with other vegetables, separately simmered, or just added directly to the soup without any prior preparation; however, they are almost always added to the soup near the end of cooking together with pickle brine. Of course, different chefs will have their method of preparation that may differ from the one outlined here, but typically these will be only slight variations. To make the perfect rassolink, irregardless of the version, the most important thing is to have the adequate amount of neutral vegetables in the soup to balance out the salty and the sour ones. Although it can be prepared with any meat or fish, this soup is often prepared only with vegetables; the one made with mushrooms is an especially noted vegetarian version. Two Russian cities, Moscow and St.Petersburg, have their signature rassolnik soups. The one prepared in Moscow is made with chicken broth and either chicken and duck meat, served topped with an egg mixture and a side of pies that have a sour cottage cream filling.

19th Century Boston Baked Beans,"This New England staple is made with white beans, such as Navy beans or yellow eye beans, molasses, salt pork, and mustard. To prepare, the presoaked beans are mixed with the remaining ingredients and then slow-cooked overnight. Traditionally, the beans would have been cooked in a clay pot in an ember-filled hole in the ground. However, in today's recipes, to cut on time, beans are typically either boiled or simmered until softened or cooked, then mixed with the remaining ingredients in either a casserole or a Dutch oven and slow-cooked in the oven anywhere from four to eight hours, depending on the recipe.

Angel Food Cake,"The first step in preparing this velvety dessert is to simply whisk egg whites and sugar until they form a glossy meringue. Sifted cake flour is then carefully folded in, taking care that the meringue does not fall, and the resulting mass is spooned into a tube pan and baked anywhere from 35 minutes to an hour, depending on the recipe. The cream of tartar, lemon juice, and salt are added to stabilize the foam, while various extracts are used to add additional flavor to the cake, such as lemon, almond, vanilla, and orange.

Bolo De Mel,"Bolo de mel is the oldest Madeiran cake dating from the 15th century. It is traditionally made on December 8 in large quantities and meant to be eaten for Christmas and then enjoyed throughout the coming year. The key ingredient and the one cake was named after is mel de cana, a local sugarcane molasses responsible for its long shelf life. The cake is made with yeasted dough that is rich in butter, lard, nuts, and mel de cana, bursting with flavors of spices, Madeira wine, and candied citrus peel. The preparation is simple yet time-consuming, mainly because the cake needs a lot of proving time — up to 3 days, depending on the recipe. The top of the cake is typically decorated with a flower motif made with nuts.

Basic Oatmeal Bannocks,"Simple in preparation and diverse in variations, bannock is a poor’s man dish from Scotland which could best be described as a dense flatbread of neutral taste. The preparation starts with the grains, which usually come in the form of oatmeal, barleymeal, rye meal or peasemeal. The grains are mixed with salt and sodium bicarbonate, the latter being a modern addition. Fats, such as lard, bacon fat, or butter, are rubbed into the mixture, which is bound together with a small amount of liquid, usually water or buttermilk. Although bannock is most commonly neutral or savory, there are also sweet bannock recipes, which suggest adding sultanas or candied citrus peel to the dough. After being assembled, the dough is rolled and shaped into a flat circle or cut into individual portions. Finally, it is baked in a pan or an oven until it browns slightly. Warm bannocks can be served with butter, fruit jams, fresh cheese, salmon, soups, and stews, and can keep well for days.","Scotland, Europe",3.9,"['125 g medium oatmeal', '2 tsp melted fat (bacon fat, if available)', '2 pinches bicarbonate of soda', '1 pinch salt', '3/4 tbsp hot water', 'FOR KNEADING', 'additional oatmeal']",4 Servings,PREP 10min,COOK 15min,-,READY IN 25min,TasteAtlas,"['Mix the dry ingredients — the oatmeal, salt, and bicarbonate of soda – in a large bowl.', 'Make a well in the middle and pour in the melted fat.', 'Stir well and add enough water to turn into a stiff paste.', 'Sprinkle the surface with additional oatmeal and turn the dough over onto a working surface.', 'Divide the dough in two and roll out each half to be 1/4-inch thick.

Cawl,"This traditional Welsh soup consists of meat — usually lamb, but beef, mutton, fish, bacon, and seafood are also used — that has been simmered with root vegetables and seasoned with aromatic herbs. The traditional method of preparation involves sautéeing bone-in meat with onions before the vegetables are added, but other methods of preparing cawl are also prevalent. Recipes vary from region to region and depend on the available ingredients but can also be adjusted to suit the personal tastes of the chef. Although this soup may contain any root and winter vegetable, an authentic cawl should always have potatoes and leeks. Cawl is said to taste better if left to rest overnight or even for a couple of days, leaving the flavors time to develop.

Finally, голодна кутя (golodna kutia) or hungry kutia is served on Epiphany (January 18th) and is made only with grains and a small amount of sweetener, since on that day a strict fast must be observed. To prepare kutia, one must soak the grains overnight, and cook them in water or milk over low heat until they soften. Poppy seeds are soaked in boiling water and crushed in a mortar or a food processor, while nuts — preferably walnuts — should be coarsely chopped and lightly toasted in an oven or a pan.

A simpler version suggests mixing the egg whites with salt and corn syrup, adding powdered sugar, mixing again, and finishing off with a few drops of vanilla extract. On the other hand, a slightly upgraded version uses a candy thermometer while boiling water, corn syrup and sugar to 246˚F, which is then mixed into egg whites whipped with salt, a little sugar, and cream of tartar. The result is a gooey, fluffy, and sweet white cream which can be used as a cake filling or frosting, or as a spread for the kids’ favorite - a fluffernutter sandwich with peanut butter.","Somerville, United States Of America",2.8,"['3/4 cup sugar', '1/4 cup milk', '1/4 lb marshmallows', '2 tbsp hot water', '1/2 tsp vanilla']",4 Servings,PREP 10min,COOK 15min,-,READY IN 25min,TasteAtlas,"['Bring sugar and milk to boil in a small saucepan without stirring.

Cassava And Plantain Fufu,"In Western and Central African cooking, fufu holds the same position as mashed potatoes do in traditional European and American cuisine. This staple dish is served with all kinds of soups, stews, and sauces, and looks like a soft, slightly elastic white purée of neutral taste. Depending on the country, the ingredients for fufu may differ. In Ghana, fufu is most commonly made by mashing together cassava and unripe plantains or yams. Fufu-like staples are widespread across the entire Sub-Saharan Africa. Apart from the ingredients mentioned earlier, they can also be prepared with cocoyams, cassava flour, maize, rice, semolina, or potato flakes, and even pre-made fufu powder which only needs to be mixed with water and cooked shortly is commonly used. Traditionally, fufu is prepared by boiling peeled cassava and pounding it with unripe plantains and some water in a large wooden mortar using a pestle. Sometimes the cassava and the plantains are pounded separately and combined in the end. As this process is lengthy — it can take up to 2 hours — and labor-intensive, it is usually done by two people — one pounding and the other kneading and turning the mixture. The modern approach suggests processing the ingredients in a food processor and then steaming them shortly while constantly whisking on a low to medium flame. Still, some people find traditional fufu preparation relaxing and perform it after a stressful week. Fufu is regularly eaten by hand. One has to tear off a small, bite-sized ball which is then dipped in soup, stew or sauce. The options are endless, but some of the favorites include groundnut, egwusi (melon), pumpkin, pepper, or okra soup; fish stew and chicken yassa.","Ghana, Africa",3.7,"['300 g (10 1/2 oz) un-ripened plantain', '460 g (16 oz) cassava', '350-450 ml (1 1/2 cup to 2 cups) water for blending', '50 ml (3 tbsp + 1 tsp) water for steaming']",4 Servings,PREP 20min,COOK 20min,-,READY IN 40min,TasteAtlas,"['First, peel the plantain and cut it into cubes.

Traditional Massaman Curry Paste,"Used in the preparation of massaman curry, massaman curry paste, unlike other kinds of Thai curry pastes, is spicy but doesn’t pack a lot of heat.

Dried Thai spur chili is the main ingredient and makes the bulk of the paste, while the remaining ingredients can be divided into two categories — dry and fresh. When talking about dry ingredients, aside from Thai chili, coriander, cumin, cardamom, mace, cinnamon, cloves, and white peppercorns are most commonly used for making this paste.

Piedmontese Torrone From Alba,"Locally grown hazelnuts are the main ingredient of the Piedmontese torrone, a variety of the ubiquitous Italian nougat coming from the north-western part of Italy and carrying a PAT (Prodotto agroalimentare tradizionale) approval. Apart from hazelnuts, this sweet delicacy is also made with honey, sugar, glucose syrup, and egg whites, while its texture can range from duro (lit. hard) to morbido (lit. soft). To make the classic Piedmontese torrone, one must be equipped with skill and patience. The hazelnuts are toasted briefly in an oven, while the honey, sugar, and glucose syrup are melted in a bain-marie. Whipped egg whites are carefully folded into the mixture until it becomes homogeneous. The mixture is then cooked for up to 8 hours while being stirred constantly, and the hazelnuts are added at the very end. The hot torrone mixture is carefully poured into rectangular wooden molds or a shallow baking dish and flattened to the thickness of 1 to 3 centimeters (½-1-inch) using a rolling pin or a metal spatula. Since the torrone is quite sticky, its top and bottom are covered with edible wafer paper ostia, which has a host-like consistency. When the torrone becomes tepid, it is cut into pieces and left to cool completely.

Dundee Cake,"One can instantly recognize this traditional Scottish, sultanas-studded fruitcake by a top pattern of concentric circles made with blanched almonds. The batter made with flour, butter, eggs and sugar is first flavored with Sevilla orange peels and optionally, sherry. Sultanas are added as soon as the batter reaches a consistency that is firm enough to hold the dried fruit, which would then ideally, be evenly distributed in the cake. Traditionally, this is a round cake in which case the almonds are placed on top in concentric rings, or in the case that it's shaped like a slab cake, the almonds placed on top are arranged into neat rows. However, in some recipes almonds may not only serve merely as decoration but are also be added to the batter. The length of baking depends on the size of the cake which should be golden brown and firm to touch when finished.

Authentic Macaroni Salad,"An inexpensive way to carbo-load, macaroni salad is a simple crowd-pleaser consisting of elbow macaroni, mayonnaise, carrots, milk, cider vinegar, sugar, salt and pepper to taste. However, ingredients and seasonings such as mustard, allspice, celery, hard-boiled egg, potatoes, onions, peas, and many more, are also often included, depending on the recipe. The important thing is to overcook the pasta as that way it will better soak in the mayonnaise, which is also often thinned out with milk for the same reason.

Traditional Okoshi,"Richly sweet and featherlight at the same time, okoshi is a simple, yet sophisticated treat which is most often sold by street vendors or in candy stores, but can also be prepared at home. First, cooked or steamed rice is air-dried until it becomes translucent. During this process, rice is stirred regularly to break down any clumps. Then, rice is deep-fried briefly in hot vegetable oil, so it expands. Once it starts floating on the surface and before it turns brown, the rice is removed and left to drain on a paper towel. Drying and frying the rice can be skipped by using store-bought puffed rice. Puffed rice is mixed with sugar syrup, or a well-known Japanese starch-based syrup mizuame, which both serve as binding agents. Butter or margarine and food colorings can also be added, along with various flavorings such as peanuts, sesame, dried fruit, soybeans, caramel, and matcha – powdered green tea. In professional preparation the okoshi mixture is being kneaded for several minutes in special, shallow and wide copper cooking pots, so all the ingredients come together. If the okoshi is prepared at home, the mixture is pressed into glass or plastic containers to keep its form. While it’s still warm and soft, okoshi is cut into square pieces of desired sizes, and served after it has cooled slightly.","Tokyo, Japan",2.0,"['1 cup (150 g) cooked rice', '40 g sugar', '10 ml water', 'peanuts to taste']",4 Servings,PREP 24h,COOK 10min,-,READY IN 24h 10min,TasteAtlas,"['Spread the cooked rice on a baking sheet in a thin layer and place it on a flat sieve or a serving tray.', 'Dry the rice in the sunlight: usually, drying takes one day during summer and two days during winter.', 'When the rice becomes translucent and crispy, it is ready for further preparation.

Eliza Acton’S Victorian Christmas Pudding,"Traditionally prepared on Stir-up Sunday, the last Sunday before the start of the Advent season, Christmas pudding is a must serve on Christmas Day in most British households. The recipe is relatively straightforward; flour, breadcrumbs, suet, dried fruits, candied peels, sugar, spices, salt, and alcohol (mostly brandy, but rum and beer are also used) are mixed into a mass. The mass is then pressed into a mold — in the past, the mass was wrapped in a cloth resulting in a cannonball shape — and steamed for several hours. The steamed pudding needs to be stored in a dark and cold place, wrapped in a cloth, to mature until Christmas Day, but can be served immediately. Customarily, the pudding is lit on fire right before it's brought to the table. For a more dramatic effect, the room where the Christmas dinner is served is kept completely dark, so the flaming pudding is distinctly visible as it's being brought in. It is often garnished with a branch of holly. As far as serving is concerned, Christmas pudding is often paired with brandy butter, brandy sauce, custard, or lemon sauce.","England, Europe",4.5,"['75g (2.65 oz) flour', '75g (2.65 oz) breadcrumbs', '150g (5.3 oz) suet', '150g (5.3 oz) raisins', '150g (5.3 oz) currants', '100g (3.5 oz) chopped apple (roughly one large apple)', '125g (4.4 oz) sugar', '50g (1.75 oz) candied peel', '½ tsp mixed spice (or ½ tsp nutmeg + ½ tsp mace)', 'a pinch of salt', '100 ml (⅓ cup + 4 tsp) brandy, plus 50 ml (3 tbsp + 1 tsp) for serving', '3 small eggs, whisked']",6 Servings,PREP 30min,COOK 4h,-,READY IN 4h 30min,TasteAtlas,"['Add all the dry ingredients to a large bowl and mix them until combined.

Spumone Salentino,"Spumoni or spumone is a molded ice cream dessert, that according to The Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets, is dome-shaped and is made up of two layers — one on the outside is a custard-based ice cream, while the one underneath is either a semifreddo or a parfait. Although there is no fixed recipe, the most common combo is the hazelnut, chocolate, and stracciatella trifecta, with the filling inside. In the past, sponge cake or Savoiardi soaked in some kind of a liqueur or wine, most commonly Marsala, would be the filling of choice. Nowadays, it is more common to find a filing of either almonds, chocolate, candied fruit, or caramel. As far as at-home preparation goes, the typical way of making spumoni is to make a light custard that is flavored with the desired ingredient, then aerated by folding in the meringue. Two or three flavored custards are layered in a dome-shaped container, one on top of the other, with a filling hiding in the center. If ice cream is used, it is often mixed with whipped cream to aerate it, although nowadays this practice is not as common, as most recipes opt for store-bought ice cream, not ones made from scratch. Most noted kinds of spumoni come from the cities Salento, Gallipoli, and Tuglie. In Salento, the typical spumoni is dome-shaped, made up of two layers, a vanilla and a chocolate one, with the filling in the center, typically one consisting of sponge cake and/or crushed hazelnuts or almonds. The one from Gallipoli is made with either chocolate or hazelnut ice cream and is filled with Plombières cream, flavored with either Marsala or Strega liquor, chocolate pieces, and toasted and ground almonds. In Tuglie, on the other hand, meringue is the typical filling. In the United States, the practice is entirely different. There when you talk of spumoni, you are talking most likely of a version consisting of layers of chocolate, either strawberry or cherry, and pistachio ice cream that is large and rectangle-shaped, meant to be cut into slabs for serving. In some cases, vanilla ice cream is used instead of the cherry and strawberry one. The ice creams can be further enriched with different nuts, cherries, cookies, and chocolate. Often, a sponge cake layer or a cookie crumb crust layer can be used as the base for the cake.","Italy, Europe",4.0,"['300 ml (1 1/4 cup) partially skimmed milk', '4 eggs', '200g (1 cup) sugar', '25g (1 tbsp + 2 tsp) icing sugar', '1 sachet of vanilla sugar', 'sponge cake, as needed', 'liqueur, preferably Marsala, as needed', '300 ml (1 1/4 cup) partially skimmed milk', '4 eggs', '200g (1 cup) sugar', '50g (1/2 cup) cocoa powder', '25g (1 tbsp + 2 tsp) icing sugar', 'chopped hazelnuts or almonds (or chopped biscuits)']",8 Servings,PREP 20min,COOK 10min,RESTING 6h,READY IN 6h 30min,TasteAtlas,"['Whisk eggs with sugar and icing sugar.', 'Warm the milk in a saucepan over low heat just shy of a boil.

Basic Natto I,"The ugly duckling of the Japanese cuisine, natto is a dish which can best be described as a thing of an acquired taste — primarily for the non-Japanese. It is a traditional side dish of cooked and fermented soybeans glued together with sticky, gooey threads, and with a strong aroma which some find unpleasant. The first step in preparing natto is washing the dried soybeans and discarding the ones which are broken or discolored. The next step is called shinseki and includes soaking the beans in water for 8 to 24 hours until their form turns from round to oval. The soybeans are then cooked or steamed until they become soft, after which the bacterial starter culture is introduced, and the soybeans are fermented for 24 hours. The starter culture consists of a special bacteria called Bacillus subtilis var. natto, also known as natto-kin in Japan, and is usually sold in the form of a white powder. This powder is dissolved in a little bit of water and combined with cooked or steamed soybeans to start the fermentation process. Alternatively, pre-made natto can simply be mixed with soybeans for the same result. The fermentation usually lasts for 24 hours and is done at a stable temperature from 30 to 45˚F. During that time a mucilaginous texture neba neba is developed around the soybeans, which signals that the fermentation was done properly. Finally, the natto has to age at a low temperature for up to 48 hours, after which it is ready to use. Besides soybean natto, there are other varieties such as kuromame (made with black soybeans), kintokimame (sweet natto made from kintoki beans), and shirohanamame and toramame (made with shirohana and tora beans). The most popular variety of soybean natto is marudaizu, made with whole soybeans. Hikiwari ground natto is made by roasting soybeans, grinding them roughly, discarding the peel and boiling them, while goto-in natto is prepared by combining ground natto with malted rice and salt and aging it in barrels. Like most fermented foods, natto has proven health benefits: it is rich in protein and vitamin K which strengthens the bones, and its enzyme nattokinase is said to prevent blood clots. This dish is most commonly served for breakfast with some rice, soy sauce, karashi mustard, spring onion, and raw egg. It can also be spread over toast or incorporated into various dishes such as sushi, savory pancake okonomiyaki, miso soup, even pasta.","Japan, Asia",3.0,"['200 g soybeans', '350 ml water', '1 tsp water', '0,2 g natto bacteria']",4 Servings,PREP 10min,COOK 50min,-,READY IN 1h,TasteAtlas,"['First, inspect the soy grains and remove the broken ones and the ones with uneven coloration.', 'Rinse the soybeans thoroughly and soak them in plenty of water for 12 hours or overnight.', 'Drain the soybeans and place them into a steamer basket of a pressure cooker.

The preparation is a lengthy one, and it starts with soaking the bitter cassava tubers for a few days, the outer layer can be peeled off before or after soaking. The tubers are then washed a few times, each time in fresh water, which serves to remove as much bitterness as possible. Traditionally, the soaked cassava would be left to drain at this point — most recipes today skip this step — and then, ground in a mortar an pestle. For at home preparation, a grater, an immersion blender, or a food processor can be used instead. Typically, the resulting mass is then kneaded, shaped into 2-inch wide and 12-inches long oblongs and wrapped in magaphyrinum macrostchym leaves which impart the chikwanga with a distinct flavor when steamed. To secure that the leaves stay in place during steaming, chikawanga is tied with rope. Apart from this basic version, there also exist other shapes of chikwanga, such as the mombamda, which is the big version of chikawanga that lasts up to seven days and is cut into smaller portions for consumption. Then there is also nsesa which is smaller than mombamda and keeps for up to four days and ntinga which is distinguished from others by its surface which has an imprint from the leaves in which it was wrapped. No matter the shape, chikawanga is steamed for anywhere from four to eight plus hours. Flavorwise, chikwanga is pretty bland tasting, which makes it a great side to any dish, and is served either warm or at room temperature. The leaves are discarded, and the chikawanga is first softened with fingers and then used as a scoop to pick up sauces, soups, or stews.","Democratic Republic Of The Congo, Africa",3.9,"['2 pounds cassava (yuca) tubers', 'banana leaves, or sheets of aluminum foil']",8 Servings,PREP 1h 30min,COOK 8h,-,READY IN 9h 30min,TasteAtlas,"['Chop of the ends of the cassava tubers, peel them, cut them into chunks, and place them in a bowl of water to soak for three days.', 'After three days have passed, wash them several times under running water to eliminate as much bitterness as possible.', 'Add the chunks to a mortar and pestle and mash until you have a smooth paste.', 'Divide the resulting paste into fist-sized batches and on a separate banana leaf or a sheet of aluminum foil, shape each batch into oblongs that are 2 inches wide and 12 inches long, then fold, so they are wrapped.', 'Arrange the chikwanga on a steamer placed over a pot of boiling water.

Oil Down,"This Grenadian one-pot meal consists of salted meat or fish stewed in coconut milk along with root vegetables, starchy tubers, taro leaves, dumplings, and (usually) green bananas. The dish is seasoned generously with turmeric, thyme, and hot peppers, but the seasonings can be adjusted to taste. The traditional choice of meat for the dish are usually scraps such as pig snout or tail, while salted fish like cod and herring are also often used. Chicken and turkey are also prevalent, especially in more recent recipes. Before cooking, the meat is soaked to remove any excess salt, while the other ingredients are peeled, chopped, and added to the pot in layers. The first layer consists of meat and breadfruit, the second is made up of vegetables, while taro leaves and dumplings make up the third and final layer.

Italian Academy Of Cuisine'S Mandorlato Di Cologna Veneta With Cinnamon And Candied Citrus,"Mandorlato di Cologna Veneta is a member of a large dessert family called torrone or Italian nougat. Since mandorla means almond in Italian, its name clearly states that the almonds are the main ingredient, alongside honey and egg whites. Sugar, cinnamon, and candied citrus fruit may also be added, and the industrially prepared mandorlato can also contain aromas such as vanilla, and glucose syrup, which partially substitutes honey to lower the production costs. Mandorlato di Cologna Veneta usually comes in the form of long bars enveloped in ostia or cialde bianche — edible wafer paper, which prevents the bars from sticking. The texture is hard (duro) and brittle, and the mandorlato is consumed after it has been broken into small, bite-sized pieces. Its preparation starts with melting the honey in a bain-marie until it becomes completely liquid. The egg whites are beaten into firm snow, half of which is stirred into the melted honey. The mixture is then cooked for 20 to 30 minutes while stirring constantly. In the industrial preparation, the stirring can last for up to 8 hours and is done in specialized bain-marie mixers, which cook and stir the mixture simultaneously so that the mandorlato can achieve its recognizable brittle texture. In the next step, the other half of the egg whites is joined with the mixture, after which toasted almonds are added. A shallow baking pan or a special wooden mold is lined with wafer paper, and the mandorlato mixture is then poured in and left to cool slightly. When tepid, it is cut into pieces and then left to cool completely. Due to its high sugar content, the mandorlato can keep for months, especially if stored in an airtight container and kept in a cool place.","Cologna Veneta, Italy",3.4,"['750g (1 2/3 lbs) floral honey', '1 kg (2.2 lbs) almonds, peeled', '100g (3.5 oz) candied citrus, cut into cubes', '50g (1.75 oz) wafer paper', '1 pinch ground cinnamon', '2 egg whites']",8 Servings,PREP 10min,COOK 1h,RESTING 1h 30min,READY IN 2h 40min,TasteAtlas,"['Prepare a bain-marie and heat the honey for 30 minutes, stirring constantly.', 'Mix one egg white into a firm snow and stir it gently into the melted honey.', 'Reheat the bain-marie and cook this mixture for another 30 minutes.', 'Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.
